It’s easy to see why people are skeptical, especially when you consider recent hiring activity and layoffs.\n\n[![](https://static.biospace.com/73/76/d045bbb74fb7b2e0625e91a11ca4/editorial.png)](https://www.biospace.com/staff-editorial)\n\nBiopharma professionals don’t have much hope for the biopharma job market turning around this year, based on a recent _BioSpace_ LinkedIn poll. A whopping 74% of respondents predicted it won’t improve until 2026 or later, and 44% don’t expect a turnaround until at least 2027. It’s easy to understand the skepticism given that the positive signs people were looking for to spur hiring, including increased funding, [haven’t materialized](https://www.biospace.com/job-trends/job-market-woes-more-funding-stability-needed-for-turnaround) as layoffs continue.\n\n![](https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/6d91aac/2147483647/strip/true/crop/795x342+0+0/resize/1440x619!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F16%2Fb5%2F7820030b4ea3a28a8ff413a5aa46%2Fjob-market-turnaround-linkedin-poll.png)\n\nBiopharma professional Pierre Michel Baez Ortiz is among those feeling pessimistic about the job market turning around anytime soon. In a poll comment, he noted that Maryland hasn’t recovered from the crash after the pandemic-era money infusion ran out.\n\n“Over three years and the region is unstable as hell,” he wrote. “There’s zero job security and some people in my network have been unemployed for more than a year, a few for several years. And now we have more big companies leaving Montgomery County.”\n\nIf the industry recovers, he added, it wouldn’t be for maybe two more years.\n\nBiopharma professional Ricardo Azedo took a more positive tone in the poll comments, writing, “I want to be hopeful, so I’d cast my vote to ‘as soon as possible.’”\n\nThat said, just 27% of voters predicted the job market will turn around by the end of this year.\n\n## Reasons for Skepticism Easy To Find\n\nIt’s not hard to spot what might be fueling people’s skepticism. In addition to factors such as venture capital funding [dropping 20%](https://www.biospace.com/vc-financings-drop-20-in-q1-but-megarounds-keep-median-deal-size-high) year over year in the first quarter, massive Department of Health and Human Services [layoffs](https://www.biospace.com/policy/rfk-jr-to-cut-10-000-jobs-across-hhs) and looming [pharma tariffs](https://www.biospace.com/business/put-on-your-life-vest-pharma-tariffs-are-coming), consider:\n\n- Late last month, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics [reported](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.nr0.htm) that the number of job openings was little changed in March and dropped by 901,000 over the year.\n- In April, job postings live on the _BioSpace_ website were up just 1% month over month and [down 8% year over year](https://www.biospace.com/job-trends/hiring-outlook-biopharma-job-market-yet-to-surge-but-layoffs-decline).\n- Although the number of biopharma professionals [laid off](https://www.biospace.com/biospace-layoff-tracker) in April dropped 22% year over year, according to _BioSpace_ tallies, the 1,357 people affected was the second-highest monthly total of 2025. (Note: Figures exclude contract development and manufacturing organizations, contract research organizations, tools and services businesses and medical device firms.)\n\nIn what’s sure to be unwelcome news, May’s layoffs have already surpassed April’s with Teva Pharmaceuticals cutting 2,893 employees worldwide. Add Bristol Myers Squibb’s layoffs of [516 people](https://www.biospace.com/job-trends/bms-axes-516-more-employees-in-new-jersey) in Lawrenceville, New Jersey, and you’re at about 3,400 people out of work between just two companies. That’s especially significant given that just over 4,000 biopharma employees were laid off over the entire first quarter.\n\nThose layoff numbers likely wouldn’t surprise Ira Leiderman, healthcare managing director at investment banking firm Cassel Salpeter & Co. During an interview for a recent _BioSpace_ article, he noted that companies are “leaning down.”\n\n“People need to husband their cash, manage their expenditures, and unfortunately, it’s costing people their jobs and their livelihoods,” he said.\n\nLeiderman doesn’t see hiring rising in the near term and theorized that mid-level and senior-level people could leave the country and head to Europe, leading to some brain drain. He also noted that biopharma professionals might change industries.\n\nFor those who need jobs now, and especially for those who’ve needed them for several months or longer, leaving the U.S. or biopharma itself to gain employment is understandable. As Leiderman said, “People have to pay their bills, right? They’ve got to make a mortgage payment. They’ve got to put food on the table for their kids. You’ve got to live the dream, but you’ve got to also be realistic at some point.”\n\n**_Interested in more career insights?_** _Subscribe to_ [Career Insider](https://www.biospace.com/subscribe-to-career-insider) _to receive our quarterly life sciences job market reports, career advice and more._\n\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.biospace.com%2Fjob-trends%2Fdoubts-about-job-market-turning-around-soon-easy-to-understand&text=Doubts%20About%20Job%20Market%20Turning%20Around%20Soon%20Easy%20To%20Understand)\n- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.biospace.com%2Fjob-trends%2Fdoubts-about-job-market-turning-around-soon-easy-to-understand&mini=true&title=Doubts%20About%20Job%20Market%20Turning%20Around%20Soon%20Easy%20To%20Understand&summary=In%20a%20recent%20BioSpace%20LinkedIn%20poll%2C%20nearly%20half%20of%20respondents%20predicted%20the%20job%20market%20won%E2%80%99t%20turn%20around%20until%202027%20or%20later.%20It%E2%80%99s%20easy%20to%20see%20why%20people%20are%20skeptical%2C%20especially%20when%20you%20consider%20recent%20hiring%20activity%20and%20layoffs.&source=BioSpace)\n- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=2120989681618413&display=popup&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.biospace.com%2Fjob-trends%2Fdoubts-about-job-market-turning-around-soon-easy-to-understand)\n- [Email](mailto:?subject=Check%20out%20this%20article%20on%20BioSpace&body=Doubts%20About%20Job%20Market%20Turning%20Around%20Soon%20Easy%20To%20Understand%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.biospace.com%2Fjob-trends%2Fdoubts-about-job-market-turning-around-soon-easy-to-understand%0A%0AIn%20a%20recent%20BioSpace%20LinkedIn%20poll%2C%20nearly%20half%20of%20respondents%20predicted%20the%20job%20market%20won%E2%80%99t%20turn%20around%20until%202027%20or%20later.%20It%E2%80%99s%20easy%20to%20see%20why%20people%20are%20skeptical%2C%20especially%20when%20you%20consider%20recent%20hiring%20activity%20and%20layoffs.)\n- [Print](javascript:window.print())\n\n[Editorial](https://www.biospace.com/staff-editorial) [Layoffs](https://www.biospace.com/layoffs) [Labor market](https://www.biospace.com/labor-market)\n\n[![Angela Gabriel](https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/abdb59b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/250x250+0+0/resize/200x200!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F6b%2F0c%2Ffecdc8734b8ea382fc8bf04c18c5%2Fangela-gabriel.jpg)](https://www.biospace.com/angela-gabriel)\n\n[![Angela Gabriel](https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/abdb59b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/250x250+0+0/resize/200x200!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F6b%2F0c%2Ffecdc8734b8ea382fc8bf04c18c5%2Fangela-gabriel.jpg)Angela Gabriel](https://www.biospace.com/angela-gabriel)\n\nAngela Gabriel is content manager at _BioSpace_.

Next week, we may finally know, as Trump teased in the Oval Office on Monday that a [major drug pricing initiative](https://www.biospace.com/policy/trump-orders-fda-to-ease-us-plant-expansion-drops-hammer-on-foreign-inspections) is coming next week.\n\nThe IRA has been extremely maligned by the industry, particularly the “[pill penalty](https://www.biospace.com/policy/pushback-against-iras-controversial-pill-penalty-faces-stiff-budgetary-headwinds),” referring to the IRA’s longer period of protection from price negotiations for biologics than for small molecules. The industry contends this [penalizes innovation](https://www.biospace.com/business/opinion-fixing-the-iras-pill-penalty-is-critical-to-supporting-small-molecule-innovation), and Trump has actually shown support for equalizing the two drug classes. At the time, BMO [heralded the order](https://www.biospace.com/policy/finally-some-good-news-trump-signals-support-for-removing-iras-pill-penalty) as long-overdue “good news from DC.”\n\nBut now, the analyst firm is asking: “Can we catch a break?”\n\nThat’s because BMO predicts that Trump’s anticipated executive order will direct Health and Human Services to use international drug prices in the negotiations that are already scheduled to happen under the IRA.\n\nTrump has for weeks suggested that he may revive the [Most Favored Nations (MFN) rule](https://www.biospace.com/policy/trump-wants-to-bring-back-international-drug-pricing-policy-reuters) proposed during his first term in an attempt to bring down costs by linking drug prices in the U.S. to international rates. “We’re being ripped off, as you know, very badly being ripped off compared to the rest of the world,” Trump said of drug prices at the White House this week.\n\nBMO Capital Markets reported that Trump may try to mash the two policies together—the IRA and the MFN. He could use international drug prices as the benchmark for negotiating drug prices under the IRA.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has already selected the [next round of drugs](https://www.biospace.com/policy/novos-ozempic-wegovy-targeted-in-second-round-of-ira-drug-price-negotiations) to undergo negotiations. In a Wednesday note, Leerink Partners flagged many of the companies with drugs subject to the next round of negotiations as specifically being impacted, plus Regeneron, Sanofi and many more. A MFN rule “has potential implications for the entire biopharmaceutical sector,” the firm wrote to investors.\n\nLeerink suggested that Trump could also pursue MFN through a Medicare demonstration or work with Congress to advance legislation to put the rule into place via Medicare. A new law would be a heavy lift, and Trump will likely face legal challenges if he were to push it through, just as he did during his first term.\n\nIndeed, drugmakers are unlikely to let the issue go without a fight. On its Q4 2024 earnings call this week, Takeda [warned of the potential impact](https://www.biospace.com/business/takeda-pledges-30b-in-u-s-argues-against-trumps-most-favored-nations-proposal) to industry. “From an industry perspective, if MFN were applied within the Medicaid setting . . . that would be an industry impact over 10 years of up to 1 trillion dollars,” argued Julie Kim, president of Takeda’s U.S. unit. “It would fundamentally be a significant challenge for the overall industry, Takeda included.”\n\nKim’s comments echoed those of Novartis CEO Vas Narasimhan. Speaking on his company’s Q1 2025 earnings call last week, Narasimhan said the MFN rule “would be devastating to the industry.”\n\nThis sentiment was backed up by a [new report](https://www.nopatientleftbehind.org/resource-materials/ex-us-report) from No Patient Left Behind arguing that these nations are getting a [free ride on U.S. innovation](https://www.biospace.com/business/low-price-drug-nations-catching-free-ride-on-us-innovation-report-says), with value assessments used in countries like Canada and Germany undervaluing innovative medicines by as much as 90%. Indeed, some executives of European pharmas have been pushing for price increases there to incentivize innovation.\n\n“We’re not going to litigate the benefits and drawbacks of the U.S. approach to paying for pharmaceuticals, but generally we believe that countries outside the U.S. pay too little for innovative medicines vs. the U.S. paying too much,” BMO said.\n\nBut while Trump failed in the past to push the MFN rule through, the BMO group thinks that this time around, the policy could stick.\n\nAnd of course, at this point, we don’t even know for sure what the proposal will be. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt foreshadowed the [executive order again](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/07/trump-sweeping-medicare-drug-price-plan-00334167) on Wednesday. “The President will make a big and historic announcement on Monday. Until then, everyone can keep guessing!”\n\n## Barrage of Assaults\n\nIn addition to the pending drug pricing policy, BMO noted the nomination of wellness influencer, vaccine skeptic and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ally Casey Means as Surgeon General.\n\n“Experience is paramount; she is not a licensed medical doctor,” the BMO group stated in an investor note early Friday morning. While Means would not have authority over drug approvals directly, she could influence public health, BMO said.\n\nOutside of drug pricing and the Surgeon General, the FDA continues to be in upheaval, with reports this week that an approval for GSK’s Nucala [has been delayed](https://www.biospace.com/fda/fda-delays-continue-as-regulator-misses-review-date-for-gsks-nucala). This follows missed target decision dates last month for [Novavax’s COVID-19 vaccine](https://www.biospace.com/fda/after-missed-decision-deadline-novavax-says-covid-19-shot-approvable%22%20/t%20%22_blank) and [Stealth BioTherapeutics’ Barth Syndrome drug](https://www.biospace.com/fda/fda-misses-another-deadline-amid-staff-exodus-structural-disruptions%22%20/t%20%22_blank). The loss of some 3,500 FDA staffers could be to blame, former officials and analysts [have speculated](https://www.biospace.com/fda/fda-layoffs-continue-as-former-commissioner-robert-califf-speaks-out).\n\nAnd there is, of course, the continued speculation over tariffs. Trump also [hinted on Monday](https://www.biospace.com/policy/trump-orders-fda-to-ease-us-plant-expansion-drops-hammer-on-foreign-inspections) that a proposal could come in the next two weeks.\n\n“Thankfully it’s Friday, as we’re all exhausted with the assault of seemingly bad news for the sector,” BMO wrote.\n\nSo rest up over the weekend, biopharma folks. Come Monday, we’re likely in for another tense week.\n\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.biospace.com%2Fpolicy%2Frest-up-biopharma-trumps-drug-pricing-policy-is-coming-on-monday&text=Rest%20Up%2C%20Biopharma.%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20Drug%20Pricing%20Policy%20Is%20Coming%20on%20Monday)\n- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.biospace.com%2Fpolicy%2Frest-up-biopharma-trumps-drug-pricing-policy-is-coming-on-monday&mini=true&title=Rest%20Up%2C%20Biopharma.%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20Drug%20Pricing%20Policy%20Is%20Coming%20on%20Monday&summary=With%20President%20Donald%20Trump%20expected%20to%20deliver%20a%20drug%20pricing%20order%20on%20Monday%20that%20Big%20Pharma%20and%20patient%20groups%20alike%20have%20railed%20against%2C%20the%20industry%E2%80%99s%20tumultuous%20ride%20is%20far%20from%20over.&source=BioSpace)\n- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=2120989681618413&display=popup&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.biospace.com%2Fpolicy%2Frest-up-biopharma-trumps-drug-pricing-policy-is-coming-on-monday)\n- [Email](mailto:?subject=Check%20out%20this%20article%20on%20BioSpace&body=Rest%20Up%2C%20Biopharma.%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20Drug%20Pricing%20Policy%20Is%20Coming%20on%20Monday%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.biospace.com%2Fpolicy%2Frest-up-biopharma-trumps-drug-pricing-policy-is-coming-on-monday%0A%0AWith%20President%20Donald%20Trump%20expected%20to%20deliver%20a%20drug%20pricing%20order%20on%20Monday%20that%20Big%20Pharma%20and%20patient%20groups%20alike%20have%20railed%20against%2C%20the%20industry%E2%80%99s%20tumultuous%20ride%20is%20far%20from%20over.)\n- [Print](javascript:window.print())\n\n[Drug pricing](https://www.biospace.com/drug-pricing) [Government](https://www.biospace.com/government) [Regulatory](https://www.biospace.com/regulatory) [FDA](https://www.biospace.com/tag/fda) [Tariffs](https://www.biospace.com/tariffs) [Editorial](https://www.biospace.com/staff-editorial)\n\n[![Annalee Armstrong](https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/08bdf22/2147483647/strip/true/crop/814x814+0+136/resize/200x200!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7f%2Fec%2Fc5c8cb664814929f5b56ccee83e6%2F5e7219dc-ab50-41ec-9a8f-35771e48c041-1-105-c.jpeg)](https://www.biospace.com/annalee-armstrong)\n\n[![Annalee Armstrong](https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/08bdf22/2147483647/strip/true/crop/814x814+0+136/resize/200x200!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7f%2Fec%2Fc5c8cb664814929f5b56ccee83e6%2F5e7219dc-ab50-41ec-9a8f-35771e48c041-1-105-c.jpeg)Annalee Armstrong](https://www.biospace.com/annalee-armstrong)\n\nAnnalee Armstrong is senior editor at _BioSpace_.

While the Seattle-based genomics medicines company lists a Boston location on its website, it is unclear if the layoffs affect one or both sites.\n\nShape’s interim CEO and chief scientific officer, David Huss, told _Fierce_ the business has chosen development candidates in Parkinson’s disease and ABCA4-related diseases and is conducting IND-enabling studies. The company does not list a pipeline on its website, where it notes that it’s realizing its vision of repairing the genetic causes of disease by combining artificial intelligence and RNA technology to make programmable RNA.\n\n**Vor Bio**\n\n_May 9_\n\nCambridge, Massachusetts–based Vor Bio is bowing out amid a tough funding environment after examining the clinical data currently available for its assets. The company will let go of 147 employees, or 95% of its staff, and expects to complete the layoffs by the end of the second quarter, according to an [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001817229/000119312525115554/d924194d8k.htm).\n\nVor, [co-founded](https://www.vorbio.com/about/founding-story/) in 2015 by oncologist and Pulitzer Prize-winning author Siddhartha Mukherjee based on work from his Columbia University laboratory, was focused on cell therapies for acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome.\n\nThe company will now cease all clinical and manufacturing activity, including ongoing clinical trials, and look for ways to “maximize shareholder value.” This could include licensing or selling its assets, executing a merger, selling the company outright or some other “strategic action,” according to a May 8 [announcement](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/vor-bio-announces-exploration-of-strategic-alternatives-to-maximize-shareholder-value). The decision to wind down operations is based entirely on Vor’s available clinical data and a “challenging fundraising environment,” according to the release.\n\n_For more details, read_ [_the article_](https://www.biospace.com/business/vor-bio-looks-for-exit-in-challenging-funding-environment-lays-off-95-of-staff) _._\n\n**Teva**\n\n_May 8_\n\nTeva is laying off some 2,900 of its employees worldwide, corresponding to an approximately 8% reduction in force, company executives announced Wednesday during the company’s first-quarter 2025 earnings report, according to various [media reports](https://www.ynetnews.com/business/article/rkgbewtgex).\n\nThe layoffs will run through 2027 and come even as the company announced its “[ninth consecutive quarter of growth](https://ir.tevapharm.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Teva-Reports-Ninth-Consecutive-Quarter-of-Growth-in-Q1-2025-With-Key-Innovative-Medicines-Growing-40-2025-Profit-Outlook-Improved/default.aspx).” Teva has in place a strategic growth initiative that it expects to generate some $700 million in net savings by 2027, while also delivering a 30% operating margin, according to CEO Richard Francis.\n\n“We’re accelerating innovative growth and strengthening our generics business, while streamlining our operations, sharpening our business and optimizing processes,” Francis added in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nTeva made $3.9 billion in the first quarter, a 5% year-on-year increase driven by a stronger market performance of Austedo, its oral drug for Huntington’s disease chorea and tardive dyskinesia. Teva’s migraine drug Ajovy and its generics business both also contributed strongly to its Q1 performance. The company narrowed its full-year projections, now expecting to make $16.8 billion to $17.2 billion in 2025.\n\n**Korro Bio**\n\n_May 8_\n\nIn a bid to keep its business afloat into 2027, Korro Bio is streamlining its operations, a move that will involve a [20% workforce reduction](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/korro-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-and-provides-business-updates), the biotech announced Wednesday alongside its Q1 business report.\n\nThe layoffs, which will cost Korro $1.2 million in one-time payments, will help the biotech advance its assets to “key value inflection points.” In particular, Korro aims to complete its ongoing Phase I/IIa REWRITE trial, which is testing its investigational RNA-editing oligonucleotide KRRO-110 in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. The company expects to wrap up REWRITE in 2026.\n\nIn the first quarter, Korro reported a net loss of $23.5 million, putting it deeper into the red: during the same period last year, it was operating with a $19.6 million loss. As of March 31, the biotech had $139.0 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, enough to support its operations into 2027.\n\nAside from KRRO-110, Korro is also working on its collaboration with Novo Nordisk, with which the biotech can advance up to two programs using its proprietary drug discovery platform. One of these programs will be for a yet-undisclosed cardiometabolic condition.\n\n**NGM Bio**\n\n_May 7_\n\nNGM Bio is [cutting 85 employees](https://edd.ca.gov/en/jobs_and_training/Layoff_Services_WARN/), according to a San Francisco WARN Notice from last week. The layoffs, which will affect staff at its San Mateo County location, will take effect on June 30.\n\nAccording to its LinkedIn page, NGM Bio has [147 associated members](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ngm-biopharmaceuticals/people/), indicating that this latest round of layoffs would represent a nearly 58% reduction in force.\n\nNGM is built around a “[biology-centric drug discovery approach](https://www.ngmbio.com/about/),” which it leverages to generate candidates with a “therapeutic area-agnostic mindset.” Its [lead asset](https://www.ngmbio.com/pipeline/) is the engineered hormone aldafermin, which is patterned after the FGF19 hormone and is in Phase II development for primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). The biotech is also working on therapies for cancer cachexia, solid tumors and the pregnancy-related complication hyperemesis gravidarum.\n\nIn February 2024, NGM [announced a merger](https://www.biospace.com/ngm-bio-has-entered-into-a-definitive-agreement-and-plan-of-merger-with-certain-affiliates-of-the-column-group-lp) with affiliates of The Column Group, which is the biotech’s “longest and largest stockholder,” owning a 26% stake in NGM, according to a press announcement at the time. The move made NGM a privately held biotech. Months later, NGM [closed a $122 million Series A](https://www.biospace.com/deals/newly-private-ngm-bio-raises-122m-for-registrational-psc-study) financing round to support a registrational study for aldafefrmin in PSC.\n\n**Mersana Therapeutics**\n\n_May 6_\n\nTo help extend its cash runway into mid-2026 and further development of a key asset, Mersana Therapeutics is letting go of about 55% of its workforce, the company [announced](https://ir.mersana.com/news-releases/news-release-details/mersana-therapeutics-announces-strategic-restructuring-and) May 6. Mersana, which is developing antibody-drug conjugates targeting cancers of high unmet medical need, expects to mostly complete the cuts by the end of the third quarter.\n\nThe Cambridge, Massachusetts–based company had 102 full-time employees as of Dec. 31, according to a March 3 [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001442836/000162828025009246/mrsn-20241231.htm), meaning the layoffs could leave the business with just under 50 employees. Mersana expects to incur about $4 million to $5 million in costs related to the workforce reduction.\n\nWith the move, the company is looking to further development of its site-specific ADC emiltatug ledadotin and will focus those efforts on breast cancer, according to the announcement. Mersana is also reducing research activities and eliminating its internal pipeline development efforts. The company noted it plans to continue supporting Phase I dose escalation work for its systemically administered ADC XMT-2056 and its ongoing collaborations with Johnson & Johnson and Merck KGaA.\n\nAs of Dec. 31, Mersana had an accumulated deficit of $895.6 million and cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $134.6 million, according to its March 3 SEC filing.\n\n**Biomea Fusion**\n\n_May 6_\n\nTo reduce operating expenses and extend its cash runway into the fourth quarter, Biomea Fusion is cutting about 35% of its workforce, the company [announced](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/biomea-fusion-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results-and-corporate-highlights) May 5. The biotech had 79 full-time employees as of March 31, according to an [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001840439/000095017025063543/bmea-20250331.htm) on that date, meaning the layoffs could leave the business with around 50 employees.\n\nRedwood City, California–based Biomea, a clinical-stage diabetes and obesity company, leases operating, laboratory and manufacturing space in Redwood City and San Carlos, California. The business is consolidating its workforce at its San Carlos research facility as of May 31, according to the announcement.\n\nMoving forward, Biomea said it will focus development efforts and investments on icovamenib, a novel oral menin inhibitor for diabetes, and BMF-650, a next-generation oral GLP-1 receptor agonist. Regarding icovamenib, the biotech plans to meet with the FDA in the second half of the year to discuss a Phase IIb trial design and requirements for advancing the drug into later-stage clinical development. Biomea expects to submit an investigational new drug (IND) application for BMF-650 in the second half of 2025.\n\nThe company is also exploring strategic partnerships for its acute leukemia asset BMF-500, whose survival data from a dose escalation study are expected in the second quarter. The move to conclude its oncology efforts with BMF-500 was expected, as Biomea [announced](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/biomea-fusion-to-become-a-diabetes-obesity-medicines-company) in January that it was shifting its focus to diabetes and obesity medicines.\n\n**Unity Biotechnology**\n\n_May 6_\n\nAs Unity Biotechnology evaluates strategic alternatives that could include a merger, sale or wind down, it’s letting go of its entire workforce, the company [announced](https://ir.unitybiotechnology.com/news-releases/news-release-details/unity-biotechnology-announces-complete-36-week-results-aspire) May 5. Unity had 16 employees as of Dec. 31, according to a March 7 [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001463361/000095017025035564/ubx-20241231.htm).\n\nThe San Francisco–based biotech, which has been developing therapeutics to slow, halt or reverse diseases of aging, expects to mostly complete the workforce reduction by May 15, according to a May 5 [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001463361/000095017025063167/ubx-20250502.htm). Unity estimated it will incur about $3.7 million in costs related to the layoffs. The company had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $16.9 million as of March 31.\n\nUnity announced the staff cuts alongside 36-week results from the Phase IIb ASPIRE clinical trial of intravitreal UBX1325 in patients with diabetic macular edema who had poor vision despite prior treatment. Unity noted that the investigational eye therapy was statistically noninferior to Regeneron’s Eylea at week 36 and generally outperformed its competitor in subjects with moderately aggressive disease. In March, Unity [announced](https://www.biospace.com/drug-development/opthea-unity-fail-to-unseat-regenerons-eylea-in-vision-disorders) that topline data from the Phase IIb ASPIRE study showed that UBX1325 showed noninferiority at an 88% confidence interval, short of the 90% prespecified threshold for the study’s primary endpoint.\n\n**Mammoth Biosciences**\n\n_May 6_\n\nMammoth Biosciences is cutting 24 employees as it restructures, _Fierce Biotech_ [reported](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/unity-shrinks-its-workforce-it-searches-strategic-path-forward-while-mammoth-cuts-24). The Brisbane, California–based biotech’s CEO, Trevor Martin, confirmed the news to _Fierce_ in an emailed statement.\n\nMammoth has 183 associated members on its LinkedIn [People page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mammothbio/people/), meaning the cuts may affect around 13% of its workforce.\n\nMartin told _Fierce_ that the company is focusing efforts on ensuring it has the right organization to drive internal programs to the clinic, support its partnerships and push forward innovative research to develop new curative therapies. The company lists Regeneron, Vertex Pharmaceuticals and Bayer as its partners on its [website](https://mammoth.bio/about/).\n\nOn May 5, Mammoth [announced](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/mammoth-biosciences-announces-nomination-of-mb-111-as-first-development-candidate-and-appoints-genetic-medicines-veteran-bob-d-brown-to-board-of-directors) it had nominated its first clinical development candidate, MB-111. The company hopes the drug candidate will become a first-in-class one-time treatment for patients with high-triglyceride diseases, including familial chylomicronemia syndrome and severe hypertriglyceridemia. MB-111 uses CasPhi—an ultracompact CRISPR _in vivo_ gene editing system—encapsulated in a lipid nanoparticle for delivery to the liver after IV administration.\n\n**Bristol Myers Squibb**\n\n_May 6_\n\nBristol Myers Squibb is making yet more cuts to its Lawrenceville, New Jersey, workforce, this time axing 516 people, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act [notice](https://www.nj.gov/labor/assets/PDFs/WARN/2025_WARN_Notice_Archive.pdf). The layoffs will come in multiple waves starting May 9 and ending March 27, 2026.\n\nBMS has its headquarters and a location housing its commercialization and late-stage development teams in Lawrenceville. It was not immediately clear if the cuts affect both sites, and the company did not provide a response to a _BioSpace_ question about that workforce reduction prior to publication of this article.\n\nThis is the third round of layoffs BMS has disclosed for Lawrenceville in 2025, bringing that area’s total number of affected employees this year to 806.\n\nThe pharma has made significant cuts to its workforce recently.

The move is meant to help extend the San Francisco–based biotech’s cash runway to support execution of late-stage clinical trials. The company, which develops oral integrin inhibitors for fibrotic diseases, did not say how long that runway will last.\n\nPliant had 171 full-time employees—including 117 in research and development—as of Dec. 31, according to a March 3 [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001746473/000174647325000054/plrx-20241231.htm), meaning the cuts could affect about 77 employees. The biotech expects to mostly complete the layoffs by the end of the second quarter, incurring about $3.6 million in related costs, according to a May 1 [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001746473/000119312525109976/d949809d8k.htm).\n\nIn February, Pliant voluntarily [suspended dosing and enrollment](https://www.biospace.com/drug-development/pliant-stock-crashes-after-suspension-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis-study) in the Phase IIb/III BEACON-IPF study of bexotegrast following a prespecified data review by an independent data safety monitoring board.

The company, which is registered in Dublin, has its primary facilities in Waltham, Mass.\n\nMural noted in its press release that in the second cohort of a Phase II clinical trial evaluating nemvaleukin as a monotherapy in patients with mucosal melanoma, the drug candidate did not meet its primary endpoint. The company also said it “did not observe a level of activity that warranted continuation” in the third cohort of the trial, which was studying less-frequent intravenous dosing of nemvaleukin in patients with cutaneous melanoma.\n\nThe company in March [announced](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/mural-oncology-provides-update-on-phase-3-artistry-7-trial-of-nemvaleukin-in-combination-with-keytruda-pembrolizumab-in-patients-with-platinum-resistant-ovarian-cancer) disappointing results for a Phase III trial of nemvaleukin in combination with Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy Keytruda in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.

He did not tell the media outlet how many employees were laid off but said the changes “particularly” affected Myeloid’s preclinical teams.\n\nMyeloid’s two clinical-stage programs are MT-302 and MT-303, both _in vivo_ immune cell programming therapies. The company is studying MT-302 for use in colon, lung and breast cancer and MT-303 for use in liver cancer. Getts told _Endpoints_ that dose escalation is underway for both therapies, which are in Phase I clinical trials.\n\nGetts did not identify which programs Myeloid has deprioritized in favor of MT-302 and MT-303. However, according to the company’s website, aside from those two therapies, the [pipeline](https://myeloidtx.com/our-pipeline/) consists of a myeloid cell editing program and a gene editing program.

A limited number of staff will remain to oversee termination of the trials and administrative operations, according to an April 10 SEC [filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1815620/000095017025052661/opt-ex99_1.htm).\n\nOpthea had 49 full-time employees as of Dec. 31, the company noted in a Feb. 28 [SEC filing,](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1815620/000095017025029489/opt-ex99_2.htm) meaning that the layoffs could leave it with around 17 people. The biotech did not say if the cuts, expected to be effective May 1, will involve its U.S. headquarters in Princeton, New Jersey.\n\nIn late March, Opthea’s COAST and ShORe Phase III clinical trials for investigational eye therapy sozinibercept—which binds VEGF, a protein that helps form new blood vessels—yielded disappointing results. Neither trial met its primary endpoint of mean change in best corrected visual acuity from baseline to week 52. As a result, sozinibercept [failed to unseat](https://www.biospace.com/drug-development/opthea-unity-fail-to-unseat-regenerons-eylea-in-vision-disorders) Regeneron’s blockbuster Eylea as the standard of care.\n\nIn its April 10 SEC filing, Opthea said one-off costs associated with the layoffs will be about $4.5 million and estimated it had cash and cash equivalents of $100 million at the end of March.

The newspaper noted that operations at the site will continue.\n\nWhen _BioSpace_ in March asked Pfizer to confirm rumored layoffs, a company spokesperson would not verify specific cuts. However, they told _BioSpace_ via email that the New York–based pharma has been “actively engaged in reducing its cost base to operate more efficiently and effectively.” The spokesperson noted that the company has two programs underway totaling an anticipated $6 billion in net cost savings by the end of 2027:\n\n- **A cost realignment program:** First announced in fall 2023, the program aimed to achieve a net cost savings of $4 billion through 2024, a goal the company met. Pfizer has increased its overall savings target to about $4.5 billion by the end of this year.\n- **A manufacturing optimization program**: Announced in May 2024, the program involves bringing the company’s operating margins closer to prepandemic levels. Pfizer expects to achieve about $1.5 billion in savings from the first phase of cuts by the end of 2027.\n\nIn separate news, the _San Diego Union-Tribune_ reported that the pharma sold its five-building San Diego campus to BioMed Realty, a life science-focused commercial real estate company, for about $255 million. The layoffs are not connected to that sale, a Pfizer spokesperson told the _Union-Tribune_.Neither the pharma nor BioMed would clarify to the newspaper if Pfizer will continue leasing buildings on that campus or move out.\n\n**Vincerx Pharma**\n\n_April 10_\n\nAfter terminating a nonbinding letter of intent for a potential merger with QumulusAI, Vincerx Pharma will wind down, the company [announced](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/04/08/3057992/0/en/Vincerx-Pharma-Announces-Termination-of-Letter-of-Intent-and-Board-Authorization-to-Pursue-Wind-Down-Activities.html) April 8.

The cuts began Sept. 8 and will continue through Aug. 1.\n\nThe workforce reduction is likely tied to the company’s restructuring, [announced](https://www.reckitt.com/media-landing/press-releases/2024/reckitt-to-sharpen-its-portfolio-and-simplify-organisation-for-accelerated-growth-and-value-creation/) in July as a “move to a simpler, more effective organisation to maximise long-term value for shareholders.” Reckitt is now focusing on its high-growth, high-margin “powerbrands” including Mucinex, which treats cold and flu symptoms.\n\nAlthough the company is cutting employees in New Jersey, it’s adding workers in North Carolina. In December, Reckitt [announced](https://www.reckitt.com/media-landing/press-releases/2024/reckitt-opens-its-largest-otc-manufacturing-facility-in-the-u-s/) it had acquired a pharmaceutical site in Wilson to expand its U.S. manufacturing footprint and produce Mucinex tablets and liquids to meet increased consumer demand.

Tango had 155 employees at the end of 2024, as per its [10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1819133/000095017025028353/tngx-20241231.htm).\n\nIn May 2024, Tango [terminated the development](https://www.biospace.com/tango-stops-early-cancer-trial-over-liver-toxicity-drops-out-of-race-against-roche) of its USP1 inhibitor TNG348, which it had been testing in patients with solid tumors harboring BRCA1/2 mutations, among other genetic abnormalities. The discontinuation was due to liver toxicities, the biotech announced at the time.\n\nA few months later, in November 2024, Tango [deprioritized](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/tango-therapeutics-reports-positive-tng462-clinical-data-and-provides-update-on-prmt5-development-program) the development of TNG908, one of its three PRMT5 inhibitors, in favor of TNG462, which it said at the time had “superior target coverage” and a better safety and efficacy profile. TNG462, being trialed for pancreatic and lung cancers, is now Tango’s lead asset.\n\n**Charles River Laboratories**\n\n_April 9_\n\nFor the second time in just over a month, Charles River Laboratories is trimming its headcount. According to a WARN notice last week, the manufacturer and contract research organization has [terminated 13 employees](https://www.labor.maryland.gov/employment/warn.shtml) from its facility in Frederick, Maryland.\n\nThe layoffs took place on March 28 and are in relation to the closure of a production plant in the area.\n\nCharles River has enacted a series of staffing cuts in recent months. In February, a company spokesperson confirmed to [_Fierce Biotech_](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/cro/charles-river-cuts-staff-memphis-cell-therapy-manufacturing-facility-latest-cost-saving-move) that it would be reducing its workforce in Memphis, Tennessee.

At the time, the companies touted the deal as the combination of two of the largest generics players in the industry, resulting in a portfolio of more than 300 product registrations with the FDA.\n\nSoon after the acquisition, in November 2016, Teva [laid off 200](https://www.biospace.com/actavis-to-slash-200-workers-as-part-of-teva-s-consolidation-efforts) of Actavis’ employees.\n\n**Oncodesign Precision Medicine**\n\n_April 8_\n\nIn its fourth-quarter and full-year earnings report last week, Oncodesign Precision Medicine launched a cost-cutting initiative that involved the [termination of five employees](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250403191014/en/OPM-Announces-Its-2024-Annual-Results-and-Clinical-Developments), which went into effect last January.\n\nAs part of this savings push, OPM also lowered the salaries of its CEO an CSO by 50%. The biotech also expects to see other planned savings from its non-priority program, as per the company’s announcement. By the end of 2024, OPM had a cash position of €5.1 million, though it has recently received €8.5 million worth of public investments, with more payments scheduled throughout the year.\n\nIn December 2024, Servier [axed](https://www.oncodesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/PR_OPM_20122024_PR_Servier_EN_vf.pdf) its Parkinson’s disease partnership with OPM, handing back rights to its early-stage LRRK2 blocker OPM-201. The partners at the time had just wrapped up a Phase I study in healthy volunteers, with data expected in the second quarter of this year. OPM was expecting a milestone payment from Servier under this partnership—money that will no longer be coming in.\n\n**AmplifyBio**\n\n_April 8_\n\nAmplifyBio is closing down its operations, according to an announcement on its [website](https://www.amplify-bio.com/). It is not clear how many employees will be affected by the closure.\n\n“This decision comes after months of tireless efforts by the AmplifyBio leadership team, investors and other key stakeholders to explore and exhaust all investment and acquisition possibilities,” the CRO-CDMO wrote, pointing to a “significant shift” in market dynamics over the last couple of years, which has dried up investor financing for early-phase development, in turn limiting the company’s opportunity to grow.\n\nIn December, AmplifyBio [shuttered](https://www.biospace.com/job-trends/layoffs-continued-across-biopharma-in-2024) its facility in South San Francisco, and terminated an undisclosed number of employees, as it wound down its R&D and characterization services.

The layoffs are effective June 2, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) [notice](https://edd.ca.gov/en/jobs_and_training/Layoff_Services_WARN/).\n\nSan Francisco–based Lyell is moving manufacturing of IMPT-314, a drug it acquired from ImmPACT Bio, to its Bothell, Washington, manufacturing facility, according to an April 1 [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001806952/000119312525070521/d920617d8k.htm).

The spokesperson also noted that the biotech is preparing to start a Phase III registrational study of a mutant-selective PI3Kα inhibitor in breast cancer in a few months.\n\nRelay’s recent layoffs date back to mid-2024. A spokesperson told [_Fierce Biotech_](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/fierce-biotech-layoff-tracker-2024) in July that the company had cut less than 5% of its workforce.

Carisma is looking at ways to wind down completely. The remaining six employees were deemed necessary “to pursue strategic alternatives and execute an orderly wind down of our operations,” the company said in the filing. “We may elect to commence bankruptcy or liquidation and dissolution proceedings, and such proceedings may delay our wind down timeframe, increase our costs, and decrease the cash, if any, that may be available for stockholders.”\n\nThe reduction will immediately cost the company $3.8 million, mostly in employee termination benefits, which will be paid out by the end of the year.\n\nThe news follows previous layoffs in December 2024, when Carisma [cut](https://www.biospace.com/job-trends/carisma-therapeutics-to-cut-34-of-staff-reprioritize-pipeline) one-third of its workforce, amounting to 23 full-time employees, including three executives and research and development staff.\n\n_For more details, read_ [_the article_](https://www.biospace.com/business/carisma-lays-off-most-of-staff-eyes-sale-of-assets-and-company) _._\n\n**Tenaya Therapeutics**\n\n_April 2_\n\nIn a bid to keep itself afloat into the back half of 2026, gene therapy specialist Tenaya Therapeutics on March 27 [kicked off a restructuring initiative](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001858848/000119312525067071/d660778d8k.htm) that will involve the termination of 30% to 40% of its staff.\n\nConfirming the layoff numbers to [_Endpoints News_](https://endpts.com/heart-gene-therapy-company-tenaya-to-lay-off-30-to-40-of-staff/) on Monday, Tenaya CEO Faraz Ali said the terminations will mainly affect research and manufacturing operations as well as some administrative posts.

Organon noted that during the first quarter of this year, it implemented restructuring initiatives that “will drive operational efficiencies in 2025,” which resulted in it letting go of about 5% of its workforce. The Jersey City layoffs are likely part of those cuts.\n\nAs of Dec. 31, Organon had over 10,000 employees worldwide, with about 1,800 people in the U.S., according to the SEC filing.\n\nThe workforce reduction follows recent mixed news for Organon.

A company spokesperson told the newspaper that Lyndra was unable to secure the financing required to complete a Phase III safety study for its LYNX drug delivery platform.\n\nThe Watertown, Massachusetts–based biotech had about 60 employees who will now lose their jobs, and the executive team and board of directors resigned March 25, a source told the _Boston Business Journal_.\n\nThe news comes less than two months after Lyndra [announced](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/lyndra-therapeutics-announces-adam-sayer-appointed-president-and-ceo) Adam Sayer as its new CEO. Sayer was previously chief transformation officer at Envision Healthcare. He replaced Jessica Ballinger, who the company noted had completed an efficacy study for lead asset oral weekly risperidone and established a strategic collaboration with Thermo Fisher Scientific for global clinical research and commercial manufacturing. Lyndra [announced](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/lyndra-therapeutics-announces-strategic-clinical-research-and-commercial-manufacturing-services-collaboration-with-thermo-fisher-scientific-for-long-acting-oral-therapies) the collaboration in mid-January.\n\nThe biotech, which spun out of the Langer Lab at MIT in 2015, had raised more than $380 million through investors and partners and achieved 25 active pharmaceutical ingredient formulations, according to the company’s [website](https://lyndra.com/about/).\n\n**Alector**\n\n_March 26_\n\nA little over three months after announcing a plan to cut about 17% of staff in the first half of 2025, Alector has disclosed another layoff. The San Francisco–based biotech is letting go of about 13% of its workforce, which is roughly 25 people, according to an [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001653087/000119312525050448/d890669d8k.htm).\n\nAlector expects to complete most of the latest cuts this month, a company spokesperson told _BioSpace_. The workforce reduction, once finished, will likely leave the company with just under 170 employees. According to the SEC filing, existing cash, cash equivalents and investments should fund the biotech’s operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through 2026.\n\nThe latest layoffs are part of cost-cutting initiatives meant to help the company align resources with strategic priorities, which include advancing its preclinical and research pipeline, according to the SEC filing. Alector disclosed the cuts about a week after announcing fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 [financial results](https://investors.alector.com/news-releases/news-release-details/alector-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial). The company’s financials for last year included a net loss of $119 million, an improvement over 2023’s $130 million net loss, as well as cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaling $413.4 million as of Dec. 31, 2024.\n\n_For more details, read_ [_the article_](https://www.biospace.com/job-trends/alector-will-cut-staff-again-this-time-laying-off-13-of-workforce) _._\n\n**Vaxart**\n\n_March 21_\n\nAfter receiving a order from the U.S. government in February to stop work on a Phase IIb oral COVID-19 vaccine, Vaxart Inc.

CMO Valerie Jansen will also be stepping down from her role effective March 31, though she will continue supporting the biotech in a consulting capacity. Elevation had $93.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of the end of 2024, enough to tide it over into the second half of 2026.\n\nElevation will now pivot to its HER3 candidate EO-1022, being developed for HER3-positive solid tumors. Despite the company’s cash crunch, CEO Joseph Ferra said on Thursday that Elevation is “well-positioned” to take EO-1022 forward, “while working to identify and capitalize on the best opportunities to maximize value for our stakeholders.”\n\n**TC BioPharm**\n\n_March 20_\n\nTC BioPharm is [letting go around 20 employees](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tcbp-announces-outsourcing-initiatives-reducing-burn-rate-and-overhead-302403910.html), or approximately half of its headcount, in line with its push to become a “leaner and more agile” company with a more decentralized model, the Scotland-based biotech announced Tuesday.\n\nThe workforce reduction is part of a larger shift within the company toward a CDMO model, allowing it to respond to larger production demands for future trials, as well as giving it the opportunity to look for alternative manufacturing facilities that can incorporate more advanced technologies. The layoffs will mostly affect employees in the company’s production and quality units and will be “substantially complete” by the end of the second quarter.\n\nThese strategic changes will allow TC BioPharm to generate around $4.2 billion in annualized savings, according to its press release.\n\nCEO Bryan Kobel said in a statement on Tuesday that the layoffs are part of the company’s “shift in focus towards an outsourced production model” and a move that “will ultimately better position TC BioPharm for future clinical trial plans as well as advancements in new cell therapy manufacturing technologies.”\n\n**Cargo Therapeutics**\n\n_March 20_\n\nCargo Therapeutics is [laying off 90% of its staff](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/03/18/3044978/0/en/CARGO-Therapeutics-Provides-Corporate-Update.html) as it evaluates its strategic options, according to a company release on March 18. The San Carlos, California–based biotech is also stopping all development operations.\n\nThe layoffs likely leave Cargo with fewer than 10 employees, after in January it let go 81 people—50% of its staff at that time.\n\nThe latest move, according to the company, is to “preserve cash and maximize shareholder value.” CFO Anup Radhakrishnan will serve as the biotech’s interim CEO and will help navigate the company through a reverse merger or other business combination. Cargo is also suspending all development operations, including work on its trispecific CAR T candidate CRG-023 and its allogeneic platform.\n\nFollowing the announcement, Cargo’s stock fell 7.5% at close of trading on March 18 but rallied to go up almost 19% in premarket trading the following\n\nday.\n\n_For more details, read_ [_the article_](https://www.biospace.com/business/cargo-lays-off-90-of-staff-and-stops-development-work) _._\n\n**Novartis**\n\n_March 19_\n\nNovartis is putting 34 more jobs on the chopping block, this time affecting employees at its Campus Point manufacturing facility in San Diego, California.

The layoffs, which will affect 23 employees are being undertaken to “create efficiencies” as Empress’ first program moves toward the clinic, the spokesperson added.\n\n_Editor’s Note (March 18): This story was updated from its original version to include comments from Empress._\n\n**Kiromic BioPharma**\n\n_March 18_\n\nTexas-based Kiromic BioPharma has put 31 staff—“substantially all of its employees”—on furlough, according to an [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792581/000143774925008047/krbp20250317_8k.htm) dated March 12.\n\nWhile the furlough lasts, affected employees will be barred from working on anything related to the company, and will not receive salary or wages, though Kiromic will be required to provide “certain benefits,” as per the SEC document. The biotech has yet to specify when it expects the furlough to end, only noting that it will persist “until additional financing is procured.”\n\nThe furlough also endangers Kiromic’s Deltacel program, an investigational T-cell therapy being studied for non-small cell lung cancer. According to the regulatory filing, employees on furlough may choose to part ways with or file legal complaints against the company, which could “result in the inability” of Kiromic “to develop its product candidates, which would have a material adverse effect” on it.\n\nKiromic was [founded in 2006](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/KRBP/profile/) with a focus on the development of allogeneic T-cell therapies.

Patient enrollment is expected to start in April. In a March 7 investor’s note, William Blair analysts said they have an optimistic view on the trial’s outcome, noting that midstage HCV trials have historically translated well to late-stage pivotal studies, specifically the sustained virologic response 12 weeks post-treatment endpoint.\n\nAtea had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $454.7 million on Dec. 31, 2024, compared to $578.1 million on Dec. 31, 2023, according to its announcement.

The Thousand Oaks, California–based biotech disclosed [in January](https://www.biospace.com/job-trends/atara-to-cut-half-its-workforce-following-fda-related-setbacks) it would let go the same percentage of employees.\n\nAtara could have around 40 people left once both rounds of cuts—expected to be mostly complete by June—are done, given it had 159 employees as of Sept. 30, as noted in a Nov. 12 [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001604464/000095017024125389/atra-20240930.htm). The biotech did not specify which locations the latest workforce reduction will affect. In addition to its headquarters in Thousand Oaks, it also has an Aurora, Colorado, location.\n\nIn its latest SEC filing, Atara disclosed it’s discontinuing development activities for and pausing its ATA3219 and ATA3431 programs. The move will include ending all clinical studies evaluating ATA3219, an allogeneic anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor CAR T cell therapy the company had been testing for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\n_For more details, read_ [_the article_](https://www.biospace.com/job-trends/atara-halves-workforce-again-pauses-2-car-t-programs) _._\n\n**CRISPR Therapeutics**\n\n_March 3_\n\nCRISPR Therapeutics is laying off an undisclosed number of employees, [_Endpoints News_](https://endpts.com/pacira-absorbs-gq-bio-for-32m-layoffs-at-eisai-and-crispr-therapeutics/) and [_Fierce Biotech_](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/fierce-biotech-layoff-tracker-2025) reported. A company spokesperson would not tell _Endpoints_ or _Fierce_ how many staffers are affected.\n\nThe biotech, a wholly owned subsidiary of Switzerland-based CRISPR Therapeutics AG, has its research and development headquarters in Boston and an R&D hub in San Francisco. It also has a manufacturing facility in Framingham, Massachusetts.\n\nCRISPR in January [announced](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/crispr-therapeutics-highlights-strategic-priorities-and-anticipated-2025-milestones) it was starting the year with a strong balance sheet, citing about $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The company also noted its 2025 priorities will include the ongoing launch of Casgevy, a gene editing therapy it developed with Vertex Pharmaceuticals. The drug has seen strong global patient demand, and Vertex has made significant progress in activating authorized treatment centers and securing payer access, according to the announcement.\n\n**Cytiva**\n\n_March 3_\n\nCytiva, a U.K.-based life sciences technologies and services company, will let go 85 people in Westborough, Massachusetts, starting March 7, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act [notice](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/worker-adjustment-and-retraining-act-warn). The layoffs will continue through at least March 31. The company has not formally announced the workforce reduction or reasons behind it.\n\nCytiva’s recent news includes a January [announcement](https://www.cytivalifesciences.com/en/us/news-center/cellular-origins-collaboration-10001) that it is partnering with U.K-based Cellular Origins to provide automated robotic manufacturing capabilities for cell and gene therapies. By combining Cytiva’s manufacturing technologies with Cellular’s robotic manufacturing platform, the companies aim to help cell and gene therapy manufacturers scale up production to industrial levels without changing the process used during discovery phases or clinical trials.\n\n**Eisai**\n\n_March 3_\n\nAs part of a strategic restructuring, Tokyo-based Eisai is cutting [6.8% of its U.S. workforce](https://www.biospace.com/job-trends/eisai-will-trim-about-7-of-us-workforce-including-new-jersey-employees), primarily in its commercial, medical and corporate functions, a company spokesperson on Feb. 27 told _BioSpace_ via email. The move, which will affect 121 employees, is part of the pharma’s strategy to improve operations and ensure long-term sustainability, according to the spokesperson.\n\nEisai’s cuts include letting go 57 employees from its U.S. headquarters in Nutley, New Jersey, with those layoffs effective starting March 31 and wrapping up May 30, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act [notice](https://www.nj.gov/labor/assets/PDFs/WARN/2025_WARN_Notice_Archive.pdf). The company spokesperson did not specify which other locations the workforce reduction will affect, but U.S. operations include sites in Baltimore; Exton, Pennsylvania; and Raleigh, North Carolina.\n\nRegarding its U.S. business moving forward, the spokesperson said that “Eisai remains fully committed to the U.S. market and will continue to serve the needs of patients and their families, particularly in addressing unmet medical needs in areas such as cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, and other neurological conditions.”\n\nFor more details, read [_the article_](https://www.biospace.com/job-trends/eisai-will-trim-about-7-of-us-workforce-including-new-jersey-employees).\n\n**Bristol Myers Squibb**\n\n_Feb. 28_\n\nBristol Myers Squibb is continuing to slim down its Lawrenceville, New Jersey, workforce, this time by 223 employees, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act [notice](https://www.nj.gov/labor/assets/PDFs/WARN/2025_WARN_Notice_Archive.pdf). This brings the total number of those let go this year in that city to 290, as the pharma earlier this month disclosed it would lay off 67 people there.\n\nThe latest round of cuts will be effective starting May 22 and wrapping up Aug. 1. While BMS has two sites in Lawrenceville, It’s unclear if the layoffs will affect one or both of those. A spokesperson for the Princeton, New Jersey–based company had not confirmed details of the layoff to _BioSpace_ as of press time.\n\nRegarding the latest layoffs, the spokesperson told _BioSpace_ via email that “We are optimizing operations across the company while prioritizing investments in innovative and transformational medicines where we can deliver the highest value for patients and shareholders. Unfortunately, there have been impacts to some of our employees as a result of these changes.”\n\nBMS in April 2024 announced it would [eliminate about 2,200 jobs](https://www.biospace.com/bms-to-cut-2-200-jobs-in-1-5b-restructuring-as-opdivo-sales-drop-in-q1) by the end of last year as part of a bid to generate approximately $1.5 billion in costs savings through 2025. Some cuts were effective in 2024 and others are effective this year. Lawrenceville’s reported layoffs from those job eliminations totaled over 1,300 people.\n\nBMS announced earlier this month that the strategic reorganization that began last year will go even deeper. The company is aiming for [$2 billion in savings](https://www.biospace.com/business/bms-adds-2b-to-cost-cutting-plans-eyes-deals-after-cobenfy-success) through 2027. Those savings will come from changes in organizational design and efforts to enhance operational efficiency, according to a fourth quarter earnings release.\n\n**Lava Therapeutics**\n\n_Feb. 26_\n\nWith just one product in clinical development, Lava Therapeutics is considering strategic options that could include a sale, merger or acquisition and will cut 30% of its staff, the biotech [announced](https://ir.lavatherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lava-announces-evaluation-strategic-options) Feb. 25. The clinical-stage immuno-oncology company did not specify if the workforce reduction will affect both its Utrecht, The Netherlands, headquarters and its Philadelphia office.\n\nLava expects to complete the cuts by July 31 and to incur about $500,00 in related costs, according to a Feb. 25 [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001840748/000110465925016712/tm257490d1_8k.htm). The company had 37 employees, mostly in Europe, as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a March 2024 [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001840748/000155837024003626/lvtx-20231231x20f.htm), meaning the cuts could leave the biotech with about 25 people.\n\nAs it considers its strategic options, Lava will continue enrolling patients in its Phase I clinical study evaluating LAVA-1266 in hematologic malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, according to the announcement. It will also still support its pharma partnerships with Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson, which involve its Gammabody platform of bispecific gamma delta T cell engagers.\n\nLava recently adjusted its pipeline, [announcing](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/lava-reports-third-quarter-2024-financial-results-and-announces-pipeline-reprioritization-and-cash-runway-extension-into-2027) in December that it would discontinue development of prostate cancer asset LAVA-1207. At that time, the company said it had extended its cash runway into 2027 based on a cash balance of $78.9 million as of Sept. 30. Lava had $76.6 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments as of Dec. 31, according to the Feb. 25 announcement.\n\n**Ryvu Therapeutics**\n\n_Feb. 26_\n\nAs part of a strategic reorganization that will extend its cash runway into the second half of 2026, Ryvu Therapeutics will cut about 30% of its workforce, the Kraków, Poland–based biotech [announced](https://ryvu.com/2025/02/25/ryvu-therapeutics-announces-strategic-reorganization-to-extend-the-cash-runway-for-the-development-of-rvu120-and-the-preclinical-pipeline/) Feb. 25. The move will leave the clinical-stage drug discovery and development company with approximately 200 employees as it focuses on advancing its blood cancer program RVU120 and early-stage assets.\n\nThree Phase II studies of RVU120 are in progress: RIVER-81, a combination study with venetoclax for acute myeloid leukemia (AML); POTAMI-61, a monotherapy/combination study with ruxolitinib for myelofibrosis; and REMARK, a monotherapy study for lower-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Ryvu is suspending new patient enrollment in its Phase II RIVER-52 study of RVU120 monotherapy for AML or higher-risk MDS. The biotech expects its next data update for RVU120 in the second quarter.\n\nRyvu had about 46 million euros ($48.3 million) in cash and other financial assets as of Feb. 23, according to the announcement. It’s also secured approximately 22 million euros ($23.1 million) in nondilutive grant funding.\n\n**Repare Therapeutics**\n\n_Feb. 26_\n\nLess than a year after cutting about 25% of its workforce, Repare Therapeutics has divulged it will axe approximately [75% of its staff](https://www.biospace.com/job-trends/repare-therapeutics-to-cut-staff-again-this-time-by-75), including its chief medical officer, according to a Feb. 25 [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001808158/000119312525033718/d859090d8k.htm). The Montreal-based biotech had 179 employees as of Feb. 24, 2024, according to an April [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001808158/000119312524117976/d23477ddef14a.htm), meaning that once the latest layoffs are complete, it may have fewer than 35 people remaining.\n\nIn addition to its corporate headquarters in Montreal, Repare has a location in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The company did not specify in the SEC filing if the layoffs will affect one or both sites. Repare informed affected employees Feb. 24 and expects to mostly complete the reorganization by the fourth quarter.\n\nMaria Koehler, executive vice president and chief medical officer, will depart on March 31. Repare intends to keep her on in a consulting capacity for three months after her separation date, according to the Feb. 25 SEC filing.\n\nThe latest layoffs were expected, as the company in January [announced](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/repare-therapeutics-announces-portfolio-re-prioritization-partnering-initiatives-and-cost-reductions) planned headcount reductions, although without offering details about the cuts. Repare also shared then that it had reprioritized its pipeline to focus on advancing its Phase I clinical programs: PLK4 inhibitor RP-1664 and Polθ ATPase inhibitor RP-3467.\n\n_For more details, read_ [_the article_](https://www.biospace.com/job-trends/repare-therapeutics-to-cut-staff-again-this-time-by-75) _._\n\n**Spotlight Therapeutics**\n\n_Feb. 20_\n\nSpotlight Therapeutics has shut down its operations, according to several media reports on Wednesday. The biotech had over 40 staff at its peak, according to [_Endpoints News_](https://endpts.com/exclusive-crispr-delivery-startup-spotlight-therapeutics-shuts-down/).\n\nSpotlight was built around an in vivo gene editing platform called [Targeted Active Gene Editor](https://www.nature.com/articles/d43747-021-00137-4), or TAGE, which resembles an antibody-drug conjugate but instead carries a CRISPR-Cas payload. The biotech was [established in 2018](https://www.biospace.com/spotlight-therapeutics-closes-30m-series-a-led-by-gv-to-advance-pipeline-of-non-viral-crispr-gene-editing-biologics?keywords=Spotlight%20Therapeutics) with expertise from some of the biggest names in CRISPR—including U.C. Berkeley’s Patrick Hsu—and with support from Alphabet’s venture capital arm GV (previously Google Ventures).\n\nThe promise of Spotlight’s approach attracted [$30 million in Series A funding](https://www.biospace.com/spotlight-therapeutics-closes-30-million-series-a-financing-to-advance-crispr-technology) in 2020 to help leverage TAGE against immuno-oncology indications and blood disorders. But the approach failed to pan out in the laboratory. A preprint published in [_bioRxiv_](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.12.30.630799v1) in late December 2024 showed that TAGE had underwhelming editing efficiency in mice, reaching an average of 7% even when delivered directly into their eyes.\n\n**Charles River Laboratories**\n\n_Feb. 20_\n\nCharles River Laboratories is trimming the workforce at its Memphis, Tennessee, cell and gene therapy facility, [_Fierce Biotech_](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/cro/charles-river-cuts-staff-memphis-cell-therapy-manufacturing-facility-latest-cost-saving-move) reported. A spokesperson for the Wilmington, Massachusetts–based company told _Fierce_ the layoffs came “after careful consideration of all options” and would not specify how many employees are affected.\n\nThe workforce cut won’t be the only one this year at Charles River, which provides products and services to biopharma companies. The company is closing its Durham County, North Carolina, facility and letting go 31 employees there, according to a Jan. 27 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act [notice](https://www.commerce.nc.gov/data-tools-reports/labor-market-data-tools/workforce-warn-reports/report-workforce-warn-listings-2025/open). Those layoffs will be effective March 28.\n\nCharles River has recently had a series of staff cuts. In November, [_Endpoints News_](https://endpts.com/charles-river-to-close-15-smaller-sites-as-demand-for-early-research-declines/) reported following an earnings call that the company had let go more than 6% of its employees, representing over 1,300 people, since 2023. The business noted during the call it had begun to close or consolidate 15 smaller sites given lower demands for its products and services.\n\nThe company had about 20,100 employees as of Dec. 28, according to a Feb. 19 [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1100682/000110068225000011/crl-20241228.htm).\n\n**Kojin Therapeutics**\n\n_Feb. 17_\n\nDue to funding challenges, Boston-based Kojin Therapeutics will soon shut down, affecting 25 employees, [_Endpoints News_](https://endpts.com/kojin-therapeutics-shuts-down-citing-lack-of-investor-interest-and-complex-science/) reported Feb. 14. Kojin CEO Harvey Berger told _Endpoints_ the biotech was months away from selecting a development candidate for its lead small molecule.\n\nThe company shared its plans to wind down in the coming months in a Feb. 13 [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kojin-therapeutics_ferroptosis-celldeath-cellstate-activity-7295989439586058240-jorH). In that post, Kojin noted it had made progress in developing first-in-class small molecule ferroptosis inducers for potential use in patients with cancer and autoimmune diseases. However, it added, it’s been difficult to obtain sufficient funding to move programs forward into Investigational New Drug–enabling studies and clinical trials.\n\nKojin [launched in 2021](https://www.biospace.com/co-founder-of-broad-institute-launches-kojin-therapeutics-to-study-cell-death) with a $60 million Series A round. The company has been focused on discoveries in cell-state and ferroptosis biology to develop treatments for use in patients with various forms of cancer as well as cardiovascular, immunologic, hepatic and degenerative diseases. Ferroptosis-modulating medicines can either induce or inhibit regulated cell death, creating opportunities to intervene in human ferroptosis pathways, according to Kojin’s website.\n\nIn its LinkedIn post, the biotech noted, “We are very proud of what we have accomplished scientifically in the past year and hope that ferroptosis-specific medicines will reach patients in need of better treatment options soon.”\n\n**Moderna**\n\n_Feb. 17_\n\nModerna is cutting 10% of roles—about 50 employees—within two digital departments, [_Fierce Pharma_](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/moderna-trims-digital-team-lays-employees-chief-information-officer-departs) reported Feb. 13, the day before the biotech detailed [higher-than-expected losses](https://www.biospace.com/business/moderna-reports-higher-than-expected-losses-while-anticipating-layoffs) for the fourth quarter of 2024. The layoffs are part of Moderna’s ongoing cost efficiency efforts, according to a company spokesperson’s statement to _Fierce_.\n\nThe company on Feb. 14 reported total revenue of $966 million for Q4 2024, down from $2.81 billion in Q4 2023. Full-year revenue also declined, dropping from $6.8 billion in 2023 to $2.81 billion last year.\n\nIn a Jan. 6 [shareholder letter](https://www.modernatx.com/en-US/media-center/all-media/blogs/moderna-2024-shareholder-letter), Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel wrote that by the end of 2024, the company had reduced its cash operating cost by nearly 25% compared to the prior year. He also said the biotech expects to “continuously reduce annual research and development costs, through portfolio prioritization and cost efficiencies, such that by 2027 we will plan to spend approximately $1.1 billion less per year compared to 2024.”\n\n**Encoded Therapeutics**\n\n_Feb. 14_\n\nTo extend its cash runway and help advance its pipeline, Encoded Therapeutics has let go [29% of its workforce](https://www.biospace.com/job-trends/encoded-cuts-29-of-workforce-to-extend-cash-runway-advance-pipeline), primarily within its technology and early-stage research and development functions, the company announced Feb. 13. The move will allow the San Francisco–based clinical-stage genetic medicines biotech to keep operating through the third quarter of 2026.\n\nThe company has around 200 employees, according to its LinkedIn [People page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/encodedtherapeutics/people/), meaning the workforce reduction could affect around 60 people and leave Encoded with about 140 staffers. The biotech did not say if the cuts affect only the San Francisco location or also its Research Triangle Park facility in Morrisville, N.C.\n\nExtending its runway will help the company achieve several key milestones, including preliminary clinical safety and efficacy for ETX101, according to the announcement. ETX101 is Encoded’s lead program, designed to address the underlying cause of Dravet syndrome, a severe form of epilepsy. The company expects to complete dosing and share preliminary safety and efficacy data in the second half of the year.\n\n_For more details, read_ [_the article_](https://www.biospace.com/job-trends/encoded-cuts-29-of-workforce-to-extend-cash-runway-advance-pipeline) _._\n\n**Third Harmonic Bio**\n\n_Feb. 12_\n\nThird Harmonic Bio on Tuesday announced a strategic corporate realignment initiative that will include a [50% reduction](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/third-harmonic-bio-announces-phase-1-clinical-results-for-thb335-and-provides-corporate-strategic-update) of its workforce.\n\nThe move comes as the biotech prepares to push its oral KIT inhibitor THB335 into Phase II development. Third Harmonic is suspending all R&D work not related to THB335 and is currently weighing options to “maximize shareholder value,” including “through a strategic transaction and/or business combination.”\n\nThird Harmonic had around $285 million in cash and cash equivalents as of the end of 2024, enough to support its operations through June 2024, after accounting for expenses related to THB335’s Phase II preparations and costs associated with the restructuring.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Third Harmonic unveiled Phase I clinical data for THB335 demonstrating a dose-dependent reduction in serum tryptase levels, a biomarker of mast cell activation. The candidate was also safe and tolerable, with side effects that were manageable or resolved through follow-up. Third Harmonic is testing THB335 for chronic spontaneous urticaria.\n\n**Q32**\n\n_Feb. 12_\n\nQ32 Bio will cut an undisclosed number of employees as part of a strategic restructuring that includes focusing on advancing its bempikibart clinical development program for the treatment of patients with alopecia areata. The Waltham, Massachusetts–based biotech expects the move will help extend its cash runway to the second half of 2026, according to its Feb. 10 [announcement](https://ir.q32bio.com/news-releases/news-release-details/q32-bio-announces-strategic-restructuring-focus-advancement).\n\nAs part of the restructuring, the company is also discontinuing its Phase II renal basket clinical trial of ADX-097 and evaluating strategic options for its tissue-targeted complement inhibitor platform, including its ADX-097 and early-stage assets.\n\nTo further advance bempikibart, Q32 plans to extend dosing of eligible patients from Part A of its Phase II clinical trial and start dosing patients in Part B in the first half of 2025. The company expects to have Part B topline data in the first half of 2026.\n\n**Inventiva**\n\n_Feb. 12_\n\nAs it moves to focus exclusively on developing lanifibranor for the treatment of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, French biotech Inventiva is [laying off](https://www.biospace.com/job-trends/inventiva-to-halve-its-workforce-shift-focus-to-mash-candidate) half its employees. The company expects to implement the workforce reduction in the second quarter, according to its Feb. 10 announcement.\n\nInventiva had about 115 employees on Feb. 11, according to its [LinkedIn People page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/inventiva-pharma/people/), meaning the layoffs could affect less than 60 people.\n\nAs part of its pipeline shift, the biotech will stop all preclinical research activities except those that support the lanifibranor program. That includes ending work on its primary oncology program meant to disrupt the interaction between YAP and TEAD that occurs along the Hippo signaling pathway.\n\nInventiva in early January finished patient screening in a Phase III clinical trial testing lanifibranor in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). More than 95% of participants have been randomized, and enrollment should be complete within the first half of this year, with top-line results in the second half of 2026, according to the announcement.\n\n_For more details, read_ [_the article_](https://www.biospace.com/job-trends/inventiva-to-halve-its-workforce-shift-focus-to-mash-candidate) _._\n\n**Viracta Therapeutics**\n\n_Feb. 7_\n\nViracta Therapeutics announced Feb. 5 that it would [shut down](https://www.biospace.com/business/viracta-winds-down-business-unable-to-weather-financial-troubles) its operations and lay off all remaining employees, which may have been under 20 people after recent workforce cuts. The closure and terminations, approved by the biotech’s board of directors Feb. 3, took effect at 5 p.m. PST on Feb. 5.\n\nThe news marked the end of what had been a tough few months for Cardiff, California–based Viracta. In August 2024, the biotech [announced a resource realignment initiative](https://www.biospace.com/viracta-therapeutics-announces-positive-data-from-the-phase-2-naval-1-trial-regulatory-progress-and-updated-nana-val-clinical-development-plan) that involved a 23% reduction in its headcount. At the time, the company also decided to pause work on Epstein-Barr virus-positive (EBV+) solid tumors and instead focus on EBV+ lymphomas.\n\nA few months later, in November 2024, Viracta announced it had [laid off](https://www.biospace.com/job-trends/viracta-therapeutics-cuts-42-of-staff-as-part-of-resource-reprioritization) 42% of remaining staff in an attempt to divert even more resources into its lymphoma program. In December, the company was [forced to terminate](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/viracta-therapeutics-announces-closure-of-naval-1-clinical-trial-and-exploration-of-strategic-alternatives) the program for EBV+ lymphoma in an effort “to maximize its cash runway” as the board searched for another route to solvency. Then, last month, Viracta was [delisted](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1061027/000095017025011792/virx-20250131.htm) from Nasdaq for failing to comply with the minimum share price requirement.\n\nBased on a recent [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001061027/000095017024126385/virx-20240930.htm) that put the number of employees at 26 prior to the cuts announced in November, the company may have had around 15 people on staff prior to the company’s closure.\n\n_For more details, read_ [_the article_](https://www.biospace.com/business/viracta-winds-down-business-unable-to-weather-financial-troubles) _._\n\n**X4 Pharmaceuticals**\n\n_Feb. 7_\n\nX4 Pharmaceuticals announced Feb. 6 it is laying off 43 people, about [30% of its employees](https://www.biospace.com/job-trends/x4-pharmaceuticals-stumbles-again-laying-off-30-of-workforce) worldwide. The move will leave the company with around 100 staff members.\n\nThe Boston-based business is closing a “research center of excellence” in Vienna, Austria, and pausing all preclinical drug candidates, according to a statement.

Atara has its headquarters and a research center in Thousand Oaks, California, as well as a location in Aurora, Colorado.\n\nOn Jan. 16, the FDA [rejected Atara’s Ebvallo](https://www.biospace.com/fda/manufacturing-issues-result-in-fda-rejection-of-ataras-cell-therapy), which is approved in Europe for patients with post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease who are positive for the Epstein-Barr virus, citing unresolved manufacturing concerns. About a week later, the FDA took the additional step of placing a [clinical hold](https://www.biospace.com/fda/fda-presses-pause-on-ataras-programs-play-on-amylyxs-als-assets) on the biotech’s active Investigational New Drug applications due to the same manufacturing concerns that led to Ebvallo’s rejection. In addition to Ebvallo, the hold also affected the company’s allogeneic CD19 CAR T therapy ATA3219, which it’s testing for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\n_For more details, read_ [_the article_](https://www.biospace.com/job-trends/atara-to-cut-half-its-workforce-following-fda-related-setbacks) _._\n\n**Allakos**\n\n_Jan. 28_\n\nA year after slashing about half of its workforce, Allakos [announced](https://www.biospace.com/job-trends/allakos-will-axe-75-of-workforce-drop-hives-candidate) it will cut 75% of its employees and discontinue further development of AK006 following disappointing Phase 1 results.

The [staff cuts](https://www.biospace.com/business/biogen-trims-research-workforce-higher-dose-sma-drug-accepted-for-regulatory-review), first reported by [_Endpoints News_](https://endpts.com/exclusive-biogen-enacts-layoffs-across-its-research-unit/), come as Biogen’s stock languishes in a five-year low.\n\nThe company is looking to “reinvigorate” its drug discovery machinery, according to the spokesperson. “The aim is to be more agile, efficient, and effective to deliver more viable drug candidates to the clinic.”\n\nThe workforce reduction is among the first sweeping strategic moves by new research head Jane Grogan, who took charge of the department in [October 2023](https://www.biospace.com/biogen-appoints-jane-grogan-as-head-of-research).\n\nGrogan, who was previously chief scientific officer at Graphite Bio, was appointed amid Biogen’s [aggressive cost-cutting program](https://www.biospace.com/biogen-axes-1-000-jobs-as-part-of-1b-cost-savings-plan) announced in July 2023, which put around 1,000 jobs—or approximately 11% of the company’s headcount—on the chopping block. The layoffs are expected to continue this year, with an eye toward saving $1 billion in operating expenses.\n\n_For more details, read_ [_the article_](https://www.biospace.com/business/biogen-trims-research-workforce-higher-dose-sma-drug-accepted-for-regulatory-review) _._\n\n**Notch Therapeutics**\n\n_Jan. 17_\n\nTo preserve cash and “explore alternate paths forward,” Notch Therapeutics will significantly reduce its workforce, the Vancouver, British Columbia–based company announced on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/notchtx_the-biotech-market-has-faced-significant-activity-7285814663907360768-G5dt/) Jan. 16. [_Fierce Biotech_](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/notch-begins-significant-layoffs-blames-tough-environment-cell-therapy-biotechs) first reported the news.\n\nNotch, which is developing T cell therapies for cancer and autoimmune conditions, has three locations, including one in Seattle and another in Toronto. It did not specify how many people it will let go or which sites the cuts will affect. There are 67 LinkedIn members who list Notch as their employer as of the morning of Jan. 17.\n\nIn its LinkedIn post, the company wrote, “The biotech market has faced significant challenges over the last few years, with early-stage cell therapy companies being significantly affected. Unfortunately, Notch is not immune from this environment. While we have made considerable progress, securing additional investment and/or additional partners to take our research forward remains challenging.”\n\n**Apellis Pharmaceuticals**\n\n_Jan. 14_\n\nApellis Pharmaceuticals on Monday announced that it was letting go of 40 employees. The workforce reduction is part of the biotech’s effort to prioritize its commercial efforts in the U.S.—meaning that the layoffs will affect employees located overseas.\n\nAlongside the layoffs, Apellis also announced that its chief operating officer Adam Townsend will step down from his role effective Feb. 21 to pursue a new opportunity. Townsend has been with Apellis since 2018 and has helped “establish a world-class commercial organization,” CEO Cedric Francois said in a statement.\n\nApellis disclosed these organizational changes during a preview of its fourth-quarter results at the 2025 JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. The company reported $709 million in preliminary full-year U.S. net product revenues, of which $611 million came from its geographic atrophy therapy Syfovre while the remaining $98 million were contributed by Empaveli, which is indicated for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.\n\nBy early 2025, Apellis plans to file for the label expansion of Empvali into two rare kidney diseases, complement 3 glomerulopathy and primary immune complex-mediated membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis.\n\n**Barinthus Biotherapeutics**\n\n_Jan. 14_\n\nTo cut costs as it prioritizes immunology and inflammation indications, Barinthus Biotherapeutics plans to axe 65% of its employees across its U.K. and Germantown, Maryland, locations, the clinical-stage biopharma [announced](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/01/10/3007623/0/en/Barinthus-Bio-Announces-Strategic-Focus-in-Immunology-and-Inflammation-I-I-and-Provides-a-Financial-Update.html) Jan. 10. The cuts, which include two C-Suite members, are expected to help the company extend its cash runway to the start of 2027.\n\nBarinthus had 130 employees—95 of them in the U.K.—as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a March [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001828185/000182818524000011/brns-20231231.htm). However, it let go of [25% of its workforce](https://www.biospace.com/job-trends/layoffs-continued-across-biopharma-in-2024) in mid-2024, meaning the latest planned layoffs may affect about 64 people, leaving the company with fewer than 35 employees.\n\nAlongside the expected staff cuts, Barinthus is also postponing further development of VTP-300 in chronic hepatitis B until it identifies a partner, according to the announcement. It therefore won’t invest in the drug candidate beyond completion of an ongoing Phase IIb HBV003 clinical trial.\n\nThe layoffs, which would mostly affect the U.K. workforce and should be completed during the first half of 2025, are subject to consultation with U.K. employee representatives, according to a Jan. 10 [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1828185/000182818525000004/brns-20250110.htm).

The Quebec-based biotech expects that headcount reductions will help extend its cash runway into mid-2027. It wasn’t clear when the layoffs will be complete.\n\nRepare, which also has a location in Cambridge, Massachusetts, had 179 employees as of Feb. 16, 2024, according to an [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001808158/000095017024021651/rptx-20231231.htm). However, in August, it announced it was letting go of [25% of its workforce](https://www.biospace.com/job-trends/layoffs-continued-across-biopharma-in-2024), which may have left it with fewer than 135 people prior to these latest cuts.\n\nRepare is reprioritizing its pipeline to focus on continued advancement of its Phase I clinical programs: RP-1664, a PLK4 inhibitor, and RP-3467, a Polθ ATPase inhibitor. The company is evaluating RP-1664 as a monotherapy and RP-3467 alone and in combination with olaparib, a poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor. Repare is also exploring partnerships for continued development of assets across its portfolio, including lunresertib and camonsertib, used in combination in patients with endometrial cancer and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.\n\n**Passage Bio**\n\n_Jan. 14_\n\nTo help extend its cash runway into the first quarter of 2027, Passage Bio will slash its workforce by about 55%, the clinical-stage genetic medicines company [announced](https://www.biospace.com/job-trends/passage-bio-cutting-55-of-staff-to-help-extend-cash-runway) Jan. 10. In an [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1787297/000110465925002278/tm252728d1_8k.htm), the Philadelphia-based company noted it expects to incur associated severance and exit costs of about $2 million primarily during the second quarter, indicating the staff cuts will happen quickly.\n\nPassage had 58 employees as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a March [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001787297/000155837024002310/pasg-20231231x10k.htm), meaning the cuts could affect about 32 people, leaving the company with 26 employees. The business has two locations, one in Philadelphia and another in Hopewell Township, New Jersey. It did not say whether the workforce reduction will affect both sites.\n\nThe company’s other business moves include transitioning to an outsourced analytical testing model following an assessment of its operating needs to support advancement of its PBFT02 program, according to the announcement.\n\n_For more details, read_ [_the article_](https://www.biospace.com/job-trends/passage-bio-cutting-55-of-staff-to-help-extend-cash-runway) _._\n\n**Y-mAbs Therapeutics**\n\n_Jan. 13_\n\nAs part of a realignment that includes establishing two business units, Y-mAbs Therapeutics expects to cut about 13% of its workforce, dependent on whether some employees accept newly created positions, the company [announced](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/correcting-replacing-y-mabs-provides-strategic-business-update-and-2025-priorities) Jan. 10. The New York–based commercial-stage biopharma had 100 employees, including 63 people in research and development roles, as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a February [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001722964/000155837024002188/ymab-20231231x10k.htm). That means the layoffs could affect about 13 staffers, leaving the company with 87 employees.\n\nY-mAbs, which has locations in Nutley, New Jersey, and in Denmark, intends to move some roles from Denmark to the U.S. to more efficiently coordinate advancing its radiopharmaceutical platform, according to the announcement. It will also make a “small adjustment” to the commercial team for Danyelza, its monoclonal antibody for high-risk neuroblastoma in the bone or bone marrow.\n\nRegarding its realignment, the biopharma, which is developing and commercializing novel radioimmunotherapy and antibody-based therapeutic products to treat cancer, will split into radiopharmaceuticals and Danyelza business units. This will help optimize resources and advance Y-mAbs’ novel self-assembly disassembly pretargeted radioimmunotherapy (SADA PRIT) platform programs through clinical development while also driving Danyelza’s commercial growth, according to the announcement. The company designed the SADA PRIT platform in part to improve upon traditional radioimmunotherapy by delivering high therapeutic dose while minimizing off-target exposure.\n\n**Generation Bio**\n\n_Jan. 13_\n\nTo support clinical development of its T cell–directed medicines, Generation Bio is reorganizing, a move that includes C-suite changes, the Cambridge, Massachusetts–based biotech [announced](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/generation-bio-to-apply-ctlnp-delivery-technology-to-develop-sirna-therapeutics-for-t-cell-driven-autoimmune-diseases) Jan. 6. The company will cut staff in Cambridge by 20% and expects to complete that workforce reduction by the second quarter of 2025, according to a Jan. 6 [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001733294/000155837025000035/gbio-20250106x8k.htm).\n\nGeneration Bio had 174 employees as of Dec. 31, 2023, according to a February [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001733294/000155837024002616/gbio-20231231x10k.htm). However, it let go about 40% of its staff during the second quarter of 2024, as reported in multiple SEC filings earlier this year, including [one in November](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001733294/000155837024014632/gbio-20240930x10q.htm). Therefore, with the latest cuts, the company may be laying off another 21 people, leaving it with 83 employees.\n\nIn its Jan. 6 announcement, Generation Bio shared it’s moving toward the clinic by deploying its cell-targeted lipid nanoparticle (ctLNP) to develop siRNA therapeutics with the goal of silencing disease-driving targets in T cells. The biotech hopes that by precisely modulating T cell activity _in vivo_, it can address high-value, undruggable targets involved in the inflammation and tissue damage associated with T cell–driven autoimmune diseases. It plans to submit its first Investigational New Drug (IND) application in the second half of 2026.\n\nAs part of its staff cuts, Generation Bio is parting ways with Matthew Stanton as chief science officer and Matthew Norkunas as chief financial officer. Stanton will exit midway through the year and become a scientific advisory board member, according to the announcement. Norkunas’ last day was Jan. 10, according to the Jan. 6 SEC filing.\n\n**IGM Biosciences**\n\n_Jan. 13_\n\nIGM Biosciences is [cutting 73% of its workforce](https://www.biospace.com/job-trends/igm-biosciences-lays-off-73-of-staff-shrinks-pipeline) and stopping development of two autoimmune drug candidates, the biotech announced Jan. 9. Following the news, BMO Capital Markets downgraded the Mountain View, California–based company’s shares from outperform to market perform.\n\nThe layoffs will affect 100 employees effective March 10, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) [notice](https://edd.ca.gov/en/jobs_and_training/Layoff_Services_WARN/) processed Jan. 14. That means the cuts will leave the business with 37 employees.\n\nRegarding its pipeline, IGM is halting work on imvotamab and IGM-2644, bispecific antibody T cell engagers for autoimmune diseases. The biotech is also considering its next business move so it can maximize shareholder value, in part by evaluating “internal options as well as potential strategic alternatives,” according to the release.\n\n_For more details, read_ [_the article_](https://www.biospace.com/job-trends/igm-biosciences-lays-off-73-of-staff-shrinks-pipeline) _._\n\n_Update (Jan. 17): This entry was updated to specify the number of employees being laid off, when the cuts are effective and how many people will remain with the company based on a WARN notice processed after the tracker’s publication._\n\n**Intellia**\n\n_Jan. 10_\n\nIntellia Therapeutics is reducing its workforce by around 27% as part of [a reorganization program](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/01/09/3007346/0/en/Intellia-Therapeutics-Announces-Anticipated-2025-Milestones-and-Strategic-Reorganization-to-Prioritize-the-Advancement-of-its-Late-Stage-Programs-NTLA-2002-and-Nexiguran-Ziclumeran.html) announced on Thursday. The company said it will focus its efforts and resources on high-value programs, specifically its investigational gene editors NTLA-2002 for hereditary angioedema and nexiguran ziclumeran (nex-z) for transthyretin amyloidosis. Intellia had 526 full-time employees as of mid-February 2024, according to an [SEC filing](https://seekingalpha.com/filings/pdf/17297126).\n\nAs part of this strategic pivot, Intellia will discontinue the development of its investigational therapy NTLA-3001, which was originally being tested for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency-associated lung disease. The biotech expects to implement the announced layoffs “over the course of 2025,” as per its news release.\n\nAs of the end of 2024, Intellia still had around $862 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. Thursday’s realignment will cost the company $8 million in one-time expenses, but will help extend its runway into the first half of 2027.\n\nLooking ahead to the rest of the year, Intellia expects to dose the first patients in the respective Phase III studies for NTLA-2002 and nex-z, with an eye toward becoming a “commercial-ready organization by the end of 2026,” according to its Thursday announcement.\n\n**Shoreline**\n\n_Jan. 10_\n\nShoreline Biosciences is laying off a yet-undisclosed number of employees in connection with a cell therapy partnership with Gilead subsidiary Kite, [_Endpoints News_](https://endpts.com/shoreline-cuts-staff-as-its-partnership-with-gileads-kite-is-now-in-flux/) reported on Thursday.\n\nCEO Kleanthis Xanthopoulos confirmed the workforce reduction in a phone interview with _Endpoints_, but declined to specify how many staffers would be affected. Regarding the partnership with Kite, Xanthopoulos said that its fate was still “to be determined.”\n\nKite and Shoreline partnered in June 2021, with the pharma subsidiary putting $2.3 billion on the line in upfront and milestone payments to use the biotech’s induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) differentiation and reprogramming platform. According to the news release at the time, the partners would initially focus their efforts on CAR natural killer cell targets, though Kite will have the option to expand the collaboration to include a macrophage program.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, Shoreline is also eligible to royalties.\n\nCalifornia-based Shoreline focuses on using what it calls “[intelligent engineering](https://shorelinebio.com/our-science/#platform)” to produce next-generation iPSC-derived natural killer cells and macrophages, which in turn can be harnessed for gene editing.\n\n**Scribe**\n\n_Jan. 9_\n\nAs it gears up for clinical studies, [Scribe Therapeutics](https://www.biospace.com/employer/2214127/scribe-therapeutics) on Wednesday confirmed that it will downsize by around 20%, [_Endpoints News_ reported](https://endpts.com/gene-editing-startup-scribe-therapeutics-cuts-staff-by-20/).\n\nThe layoffs come as Scribe prepares to initiate clinical trials, CEO Ben Oakes told _Endpoints_. The company has yet to announce a timeline for its entry into the clinic, but Oakes noted that “the technologies we’ve built have continued to prove themselves to be so strong that we can really go quite rapidly from idea to a developable drug.”\n\n[Launched in 2020](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201006005510/en/Scribe-Therapeutics-Unveils-Fully-Integrated-Platform-for-Engineering-Breakthrough-CRISPR-based-Genetic-Medicines), Scribe was co-founded by Nobel Laureate Jennifer Doudna and leverages proprietary [CRISPR-based drug design and development platforms](https://www.scribetx.com/platform), including those that can be used to produce genetic and epigenetic editors. Its pipeline includes STX1100, which targets the _PCSK9_ gene to lower elevated LDL-C levels, and STX1400, designed against _APOC3_ and being tested for severe hypertriglyceridemia and familial chylomicronemia syndrome.\n\nScribe is also [partnered with Lilly subsidiary Prevail](https://www.biospace.com/lilly-s-prevail-doudna-s-scribe-partner-on-genetic-treatments-for-neuro-diseases) to develop CRISPR-based therapies for neurological and neuromuscular diseases and [with Sanofi](https://www.biospace.com/sanofi-and-jennifer-doudna-founded-scribe-ink-1-billion-plus-crispr-tech-deal) to advance ex-vivo cell therapies for cancer indications.\n\n**Resilience**\n\n_Jan. 9_\n\nSan Diego–based Resilience will lay off 120 employees at its Research Triangle Park gene therapy facility in Durham, North Carolina, effective Dec. 15, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) [notice](https://www.commerce.nc.gov/data-tools-reports/labor-market-data-tools/workforce-warn-reports/report-workforce-warn-listings-2025/open).

As a result of the reorganization, the business plans to close its site in France and decrease staff in Belgium.\n\nThe new entities will be a yet-to-be-named innovative medicines specialist and a cell therapy company that will inherit the Galapagos name. The Belgian biotech will also take back the rights to its pipeline from Gilead and discontinue its small molecules program, according to the announcement.\n\nIn the press release, Galapagos CEO Paul Stoffels called the separation into two entities a “critical step” for unlocking significant shareholder value, one that will position the company for sustainable growth and future success in its renewed focus on cell therapies.\n\n_For more details, read_ [_the article_](https://www.biospace.com/business/galapagos-to-spin-out-innovative-medicines-lay-off-40) _._\n\n**Cassava**\n\n_Jan. 8_\n\nCassava Sciences on Tuesday announced that it will [lay off 10 employees](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/cassava-sciences-provides-a-business-update-january-7-2025)—accounting for around 33% of its headcount—in an attempt to cut costs. The terminations will take place in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nAside from the layoffs, Cassava will also employ “continuing strategic expense management efforts,” including halting previously planned biomarker analyses of plasma samples from prior trials. The biotech expects to absorb around $400,000 in one-time costs related to the layoffs. As of December 31, 2024, Cassava had $128.6 million in unaudited cash and cash equivalents.\n\nTuesday’s announcement comes after Cassava’s Alzheimer’s disease drug candidate simufilam [failed](https://www.biospace.com/drug-development/cassavas-shares-plunge-as-alzheimers-drug-fails-phase-3) the Phase III RETHINK-ALZ trial in November 2024. At the time, the biotech disclosed that simufilam was unable to significantly lower cognitive and functional decline in Alzheimer’s patients, as compared with placebo. RETHINK-ALZ also failed its secondary and exploratory biomarker endpoints.\n\nThe readout triggered a massive selloff, sending Cassava’s shares crashing 85% in the aftermath of the failure.\n\n**CytomX Therapeutics**\n\n_Jan. 8_\n\nTo direct capital resources to its clinical programs and create flexibility in its cost structure, CytomX Therapeutics will cut about [40% of its employees](https://www.biospace.com/job-trends/cytomx-to-cut-40-of-staff-as-it-updates-pipeline-priorities), the San Francisco–based biotech [announced](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/cytomx-therapeutics-announces-2025-strategic-pipeline-priorities-and-provides-corporate-update) Jan. 6. The exact number of people affected is 46, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) [notice](https://edd.ca.gov/en/jobs_and_training/Layoff_Services_WARN/), likely leaving the biotech with fewer than 70 employees.\n\nCytomX’s top strategic objective for 2025 is development of CX-2051, an antibody-drug conjugate being developed initially in advanced metastatic colorectal cancer, according to the Jan. 6 announcement. Meanwhile, the biotech has noted some hesitation about CX-904, a T-cell-engaging bispecific antibody it’s working on with Amgen.

The company has 47 employees, according to its LinkedIn [People page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/veliatx/people/) and [PitchBook](https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/495398-44#overview).\n\nIn an emailed statement to _Endpoints_ Jan. 6, Velia CEO John McHutchison said, “We are disappointed with this outcome, and also to have to let go of our outstanding team, and we appreciate their valuable contributions at Velia. The decision is unrelated to the therapeutic potential of microproteins, our platform and our scientific progress.”\n\n_Endpoints_ did not report when Velia’s wind-down will be complete.\n\n**Oxular**\n\n_Jan. 3_\n\nFollowing [Regeneron’s](https://www.biospace.com/employer/395032/regeneron-pharmaceuticals-inc) acquisition of U.K.-based biotech Oxular, which develops retinal treatments, an undetermined number of Oxular employees are losing their jobs, _Fierce Biotech_ [reported](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/regeneron-acquires-uk-biotech-adding-oxulars-eye-disease-delivery-tech-portfolio) Jan. 2. A Regeneron spokesperson told _Fierce_ that no Oxular employees will join the New York–based biotech, although some will provide short-term consulting help with tech transfer and transition work.\n\nIt’s unclear how many Oxular employees the deal affected. While the biotech’s LinkedIn [People page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/oxular/people/) shows 13 “associated members” as of Jan. 3, _Fierce_ reported the company had 20 employees upon acquisition, based on LinkedIn data at that time. The deal closed at the end of 2024, according to _Fierce_.\n\nRegeneron and Oxular had not announced the acquisition as of early morning Jan. 3. However, Mark Gaffney, a former Oxular board member whose role as CEO ended in June 2024, shared the news Jan. 2 on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mark-gaffney-b97a7812b_i-am-happy-to-report-that-oxular-has-been-activity-7280624147506892801-iOOB/).

Details about the number of employees being let go was not reported.\n\n“As we look towards the future of Javara, we are focused on becoming even more agile and better equipped to meet the evolving needs of our patients, sites, healthcare partners and sponsor clients,” a Javara spokesperson wrote in an email to the publication. “To reach these goals, we made the decision to reduce operational complexities and simplify select workflows.”\n\n**Ring Therapeutics**\n\n_Dec. 18_\n\nRing Therapeutics has parted ways with “just under 50%” of its employees, a spokesperson told [_Endpoints News_](https://endpts.com/ring-therapeutics-cuts-workforce-in-latest-round-of-layoffs/) on Wednesday. Ring, a five-year-old Cambridge, Mass.–based Flagship startup focused on gene therapy, now has about 40 staff members left.\n\n“We recently made the decision to focus on Anellobricks, Ring’s proprietary genetic medicine vector platform, which affords exceptional scalability and has the potential to transform genetic medicine,” the spokesperson wrote to _Endpoints_. “As a result, we have reduced our current staff to ensure we have the right mix of skills and capabilities to continue to grow as our pipeline progresses and we advance toward the clinic.”\n\n**Outlook Therapeutics**\n\n_Dec. 17_\n\nJust weeks after announcing disappointing clinical trial results for its ophthalmic drug, Outlook Therapeutics [announced](https://ir.outlooktherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/outlook-therapeuticsr-streamlines-operations) it’s cut 23% of its workforce to help reduce costs, extend its cash runway and secure FDA approval of bevacizumab. The Iselin, New Jersey–based biopharma expects the move will save $1.4 million annually, excluding workforce reduction expenses.\n\nFive employees were let go, according to a Dec. 16 SEC [filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1649989/000110465924128901/tm2431046d1_8k.htm). The cuts likely leave Outlook with 16 employees.\n\nOn Nov. 27, the company [announced](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/outlook-therapeutics-announces-preliminary-topline-results-of-norse-eight-clinical-trial) its NORSE EIGHT clinical trial evaluating bevacizumab in wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients had failed to meet the FDA’s prespecified non-inferiority endpoint at week eight. However, Outlook noted that preliminary data showed an improvement in vision, the presence of biologic activity and a continued favorable safety profile.\n\nThe company expects to announce additional trial data in January and plans to resubmit a biologics license application in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nWhile the FDA in 2023 [nixed approval](https://www.biospace.com/outlook-therapeutics-provides-regulatory-update-on-fda-review-of-ons-5010-lytenava-bevacizumab-vikg-for-the-treatment-of-wet-amd) for bevacizumab to treat wet AMD, the drug has European Commission marketing authorization.

There’ll be two rounds of layoffs—with the first effective Dec. 13 and the second on or about March 31—and the site will close on or about April 1.\n\nBavarian acquired the San Diego facility from Emergent BioSolutions in 2023 as part of a [deal](https://www.biospace.com/emergent-biosolutions-finalizes-sale-of-travel-health-business-to-bavarian-nordic) that gave the vaccine maker Emergent’s travel health business. In addition to the R&D site, Bavarian received the rights to Vivotif, a typhoid vaccine; Vaxchora, a cholera vaccine; and CHIKV VLP, a chikungunya vaccine candidate that’s now in Phase III clinical development.\n\nThe company also [announced](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/bavarian-nordic-to-launch-dkk-150-million-share-buy-back-program) this week that it plans to buy back up to 150 million Danish kroner ($21 million) of its shares. Bavarian stated the decision should be viewed in the context of “improved visibility” around its travel health business, citing events including the near-term completion of the integration of assets from Emergent. That integration, Bavarian stated, includes a “final restructuring” of the R&D organization, which it expects will generate annual savings of 50 million to 75 million Danish kroner ($7 million to $10.5 million).\n\nOnce the San Diego site closes, Bavarian’s remaining U.S. presence will be its U.S. subsidiary in Durham, North Carolina.\n\n**BenevolentAI**\n\n_Dec. 12_\n\nBenevolentAI will cut its workforce as part of a strategic overhaul aimed at streamlining operations, reducing costs and returning to its core mission of technology in service of science, the company [announced](https://www.benevolent.com/news-and-media/press-releases-and-in-media/benevolentai-unveils-major-strategic-overhaul-return-original-mission/) Dec. 11. The London-based business did not share how many people the workforce reduction will affect.\n\nThe layoffs are not BenevolentAI’s first employee cuts. In May 2023, the company [announced](https://www.biospace.com/benevolentai-cuts-workforce-pipeline-in-strategic-realignment) it would let go about 180 people as part of a reorganization designed to optimize its pipeline and technology platforms to reduce costs and maximize value for stakeholders. In April 2024, BenevolentAI [announced](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240422096220/en/BenevolentAI-Provides-an-Update-on-Its-Business-Priorities) it would cut 30% of staff. It also closed its U.S. office.\n\nMoving forward, the company will focus on creating standalone products that meet its partners’ drug development needs, Kenneth Mulvany, executive chairman, founder and activist shareholder, said in the announcement. He noted that BenevolentAI’s new strategic direction “builds on our strengths, empowering the biopharma industry with cutting-edge AI technologies backed by our compelling industry and patient proof points.”\n\nBased on anticipated savings from streamlined operational efforts, the company expects to extend its cash runway into 2027.\n\n**Chroma Medicine and Nvelop Therapeutics**\n\n_Dec. 12_\n\nAs part of Massachusetts-based Chroma Medicine and Nvelop Therapeutics’ merger, an unspecified number of employees will be laid off due to areas of redundancies and overlap, _Fierce Biotech_ [reported](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/two-boston-area-biotechs-shed-staff-fuse-form-genetic-medicines-company-nchroma-bio).\n\nBoston-based Chroma and Cambridge-based Nvelop [announced](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/chroma-medicine-and-nvelop-therapeutics-unite-to-form-nchroma-bio-securing-75-million-to-accelerate-genetic-medicines) their merger Dec. 11. The combined entity, nChroma Bio, has secured $75 million in new financing. That money, in addition to the cash on hand for both companies at the time of the deal, will provide multiple years of runway, according to the announcement.\n\nThe funds will also aid continued development of nChroma’s epigenetic editing platform and advance lead candidate CRMA-1001 into the clinic and to key data readouts. CRMA-1001 is a liver-targeted epigenetic editing therapy intended to treat chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis D coinfection.\n\n**Cellectar Biosciences**\n\n_Dec. 11_\n\nCellectar Biosciences on Tuesday [kicked off](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/cellectar-biosciences-provides-strategic-update-on-clinical-development-pipeline-programs-and-corporate-restructuring) a strategic reprioritization initiative that will involve an “immediate reduction in headcount” of 60%. The biotech expects to complete the layoffs in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nThe move follows the biotech’s communications with FDA regarding its cancer drug candidate iopofosine I 131. The regulator had indicated in early 2024 that Cellectar could seek accelerated approval for iopofosine I 131 using the company’s ongoing CLOVER WaM trial. Now, however, the FDA has said the biotech will need to run an additional randomized and controlled confirmatory study to support a regulatory application.\n\nIn light of this change in requirements, Cellectar has decided to pursue strategic opportunities to support the further development and commercialization of iopofosine I 131. “We have determined that such a program may best be brought to market by a larger organization with greater resources,” CEO James Caruso said in a statement.\n\nCellectar expects the restructuring effort to extend its cash runway into the third quarter of 2025.\n\n**Carisma Therapeutics**\n\n_Dec. 10_\n\nAs part of a strategic restructuring that includes reprioritizing its pipeline to focus on fibrosis, oncology and autoimmune disease therapies, Carisma Therapeutics will lay off 34% of its employees, the Philadelphia-based biopharma [announced](https://www.biospace.com/job-trends/carisma-therapeutics-to-cut-34-of-staff-reprioritize-pipeline) Dec. 9. The cuts includes 23 full-time employees, including three executives and research and development staff, according to a Dec. 9 [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1485003/000110465924126550/tm2430483d1_8k.htm).\n\nThe company also underwent a workforce reduction earlier this year. In April, Carisma [announced](https://www.biospace.com/carisma-therapeutics-provides-business-update-and-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2023-financial-results) it would cut staff by about 37% during the second quarter. According to an April 1 [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001485003/000148500324000005/carm-20231231.htm), the company had 107 full-time employees as of Dec. 31. This would likely leave Carisma with 44 full-time employees once the latest cuts are complete.\n\nIn addition to its workforce reduction, Carisma’s strategic restructuring includes ending development of CT-0525, a gene-modified autologous chimeric antigen receptor-monocyte (CAR-M) cellular therapy intended to treat solid tumors that overexpress human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) metastasis.\n\n_For more details, read_ [_the article_](https://www.biospace.com/job-trends/carisma-therapeutics-to-cut-34-of-staff-reprioritize-pipeline) _._\n\n**Belharra Therapeutics**\n\n_Dec. 10_\n\nBelharra Therapeutics, a San Diego–based startup working on small molecule oncology and immunology drugs, has cut 21 employees, leaving it with 30 people, down from 52 in June, _Endpoints News_ [reported](https://endpts.com/belharra-therapeutics-sticks-with-lead-programs-trims-workforce-by-40/) on Dec. 9.\n\nThe employee cuts are expected to allow Belharra to extend its runway to achieve “key inflection points” while alleviating capital raise pressures, according to a spokesperson’s emailed statement to _Endpoints_. That spokesperson also wrote that the biotech will continue advancing its lead programs and working with partners Genentech and Sanofi.\n\nBelharra [announced](https://www.biospace.com/belharra-therapeutics-announces-strategic-collaboration-with-sanofi-to-advance-discovery-of-novel-small-molecule-therapeutics-for-immunological-diseases) its partnership with Sanofi in June, stating that the collaboration would leverage Belharra’s non-covalent chemoproteomics platform to identify and advance small molecules against undisclosed Sanofi-designated immunology targets. _BioSpace_ named the move one of the [top immunology and inflammation deals](https://www.biospace.com/deals/top-i-i-deals-so-far-in-2024) of 2024 at that time. Belharra is eligible to receive up to nearly $700 million in aggregate research, development and commercial milestone payments and royalties on net sales.\n\nBelharra [launched](https://www.biospace.com/belharra-launches-with-130m-from-versant-genentech-to-advance-chemoproteomics-platform) in January 2023 with $130 million in total funding that included $80 million upfront from Genentech, with whom it had inked a multiyear partnership. The biotech also received $50 million in Series A financing from Versant Ventures. In January, _BioSpace_ named Belharra to its [NextGen Bio Class of 2024](https://www.biospace.com/nextgen-class-of-2024-top-life-sciences-startups-to-watch-this-year) list, which recognized the hottest new life sciences companies in the U.S.\n\n**December 9**\n\nNational Resilience on Friday announced that it is [laying off 105 employees](https://reactwarn.floridajobs.org/WarnList/Records?year=2024) from its site in Alachua, Florida, as part of a strategic refocusing initiative.\n\nThe affected employees will start being let go in February 2025, with terminations to continue through June of next year. In a statement to [_Fierce Pharma_](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/cdmo-resilience-plots-105-layoffs-florida-plant-it-acquired-2021), a Resilience spokesperson said that the CDMO is downsizing its Florida presence “to focus more strategically on commercial development and manufacturing to meet customers’ demands and patients’ needs.”\n\nResilience will continue to fulfill its contract obligations with the customers of the Florida site, according to the spokesperson.\n\nResilience came to own the Alachua facility after it [bought Ology Bioservices in April 2021](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210412005972/en/Resilience-Continues-Expansion-with-Acquisition-of-Biologics-Manufacturing-Company-Ology-Bioservices).

The Lexington, Massachusetts–based immuno-oncology company did not offer details on the layoffs, such as how many people they’ll affect or which locations they’ll involve.\n\nAccording to a March [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001098972/000095017024031620/agen-20231231.htm), Agenus had 389 employees as of the beginning of that month. In addition to its Lexington headquarters, the company also has sites in Berkeley, Emeryville and Vacaville, California, and in Cambridge, England.\n\nIn its Dec. 5 announcement, Agenus noted it will concentrate resources on its lead botensilimab/balstilimab (BOT/BAL) program, which has “demonstrated robust clinical activity” in several types of cancer, including microsatellite stable colorectal cancer (MSS CRC). That regimen made the news earlier this year, when the FDA [advised against](https://www.biospace.com/drug-development/future-of-agenus-immunotherapy-combo-uncertain-as-fda-discourages-accelerated-approval-in-crc) the company applying for accelerated approval for BOT/BAL to treat relapsed/refractory MSS CRC without active liver metastases.\n\nAs Agenus moves forward with advancing BOT/BAL through clinical development and preparing for global regulatory submissions, it’s also working on significant cost reductions, as noted in its Dec. 5 announcement. The company is targeting a 60% cut in annual expenditures and hopes to lower its fiscal year 2025 cash burn to about $100 million. Agenus also recently secured a $22 million mortgage to boost its cash reserves.\n\n**December 3**\n\nSwedish biotech Alligator Bioscience on Dec. 2 announced that it will [lay off 70% of its employees](https://www.biospace.com/business/alligator-axes-70-of-staff-amid-capital-constraints-renews-pancreatic-cancer-focus) in a sweeping strategic re-evaluation campaign.\n\nAfter the workforce reduction, the company will be down to 15 full-time staff. The layoffs, which are still subject to negotiation with trade unions, will mainly affect employees working in discovery and other nonclinical posts. Alligator expects the restructuring to lower its operating expenses by around $5.9 million annually.\n\nIn its [press release](https://alligatorbioscience.se/en/mfn_news/alligator-sharpens-focus-on-mitazalimab-and-announces-cost-reduction-program-to-maximize-long-term-value-creation/), the biotech cited its “current capital constraints” as the reason for the strategic restructuring.

The biotech expects those cuts to mainly affect its research and development and support functions at its headquarters near Basel, Switzerland. The company has one U.S. site, located in Radnor, Pennsylvania.\n\nRegarding the global rights to aprocitentan, sold in the U.S. as Tryvio, Idorsia has entered into exclusive negotiations with an undisclosed company. As part of those discussions, the biotech noted it will receive a $35 million exclusivity fee that will extend its cash runway into 2025.\n\nAccording to Idorsia, the agreement under discussion could include an upfront payment, milestone payments and tiered royalties on sales in return for the transfer of global rights to the drug and some company employees.

Together, Recursion and Exscientia had a headcount of around 800, according to a [press release](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/11/20/2984282/0/en/Recursion-and-Exscientia-two-leaders-in-the-AI-drug-discovery-space-have-officially-combined-to-advance-the-industrialization-of-drug-discovery.html) last week announcing the completion of the acquisition agreement.\n\n“With any merger, there are bound to be some redundancies and leadership changes,” Kelly told _STAT_.\n\nRecursion and Exscientia [first announced the merger](https://www.biospace.com/deals/recursion-exscientia-merge-to-create-ai-enabled-biotech) in August 2024, which created a combined company carrying Recursion’s name with around $850 million in cash and cash equivalents—plus $100 million in annual synergies—which could support the combined entity into 2027. Both companies also have outstanding contracts that could yield additional milestone payments from powerhouse partners, including Sanofi, Merck KGaA, Roche and Bayer.\n\nIn total, the combined company is looking at more than 10 clinical and preclinical pipeline programs, on top of 10 advanced discovery programs and over 10 partnered programs. Many trials of its clinical candidates are expected to read out in the next 18 months.\n\n**November 26**\n\nMedigene on Tuesday [kicked off](https://medigene.com/medigene-ag-announces-refocus-of-corporate-strategy-and-organizational-realignment-2/) a broad organizational realignment campaign as it struggles to find the resources to support its operations into 2026.\n\nPart of this program is a steep workforce reduction. Around 40% of the German biotech’s employees will be let go in 2025—a “difficult decision to make,” according to CEO Selwyn Ho, who nevertheless noted that the layoffs are “a necessary step to ensure the long-term success of Medigene.”\n\nThe company will retain employees whose roles are critical for its new direction of focusing on R&D activities with the greatest potential for return on investment, as per the biotech’s news release.\n\nMedigene on Tuesday also maintained its full-year 2024 guidance, including its prior estimation that its current cash runway will keep it afloat into July 2025. “The Company continues to evaluate all appropriate financing and strategic options to advance its cash runway into 2026 and beyond,” according to the news release.\n\nIn 2025, Medigene will focus its resources on the development of T-cell receptor (TCR)-guided therapies, optimized for sensitivity, specificity and safety, designed specifically for use in off-the-shelf modalities. The biotech will also prioritize its TCR-guided T cell engager MDG3010 in partnership with WuXi Biologics.\n\n**November 26**\n\nAlector will [let go](https://investors.alector.com/news-releases/news-release-details/alector-announces-results-al002-invoke-2-phase-2-trial/) of 41 employees—or around 17% of its total headcount—after revealing [disappointing Phase II findings](https://www.biospace.com/drug-development/alectors-abbvie-partnered-alzheimers-program-fails-phase-ii-triggering-a-17-layoff) for its Alzheimer’s disease antibody AL002 on Monday.\n\nThe layoffs are part of a sweeping realignment initiative, which Alector will implement to better align its resources with its new strategic priorities. Moving forward, the biotech will focus on its progranulin programs latozinemab and AL101/GSK4527226, which are being developed for frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, respectively.\n\nIn connection with the workforce reduction, Alector expects to absorb a one-time cost of $3.9 million, associated mostly with severance payments and other related expenses. According to an [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1653087/000095017024130564/alec-20241125.htm) on Monday, the layoffs will take place in the first half of 2025.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Alector had $457.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments, which the biotech expects will give it enough runway through 2026.\n\nAlector was down 31% in after-hours trading on Monday, in reaction to its Alzheimer’s readout.\n\n**November 26**\n\nAs part of its drive to lower expenditure by around $1.5 billion through 2025, [Bristol Myers Squibb](https://www.biospace.com/employer/400424/bristol-myers-squibb-company) announced plans to [lay off around 195 more employees](https://www.nj.gov/labor/assets/PDFs/WARN/2024_WARN_Notice_Archive.pdf) from its Lawrenceville, New Jersey sites.\n\nThe terminations will start on Feb. 13, 2025 and run through the end of next year, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification record. This latest round of workforce reductions brings BMS’s layoff total to nearly 1,330 this year. The job cuts started in March 2024, with 75 employees terminated. The pharma’s largest layoff round came in May 2024 and affected nearly 780 members of its staff.\n\nBMS first announced its sweeping strategic initiative alongside its [first-quarter earnings report in April 2024](https://www.biospace.com/bms-to-cut-2-200-jobs-in-1-5b-restructuring-as-opdivo-sales-drop-in-q1), noting that it plans to reduce management layers and streamline decision-making throughout the company. Core to this push is a headcount reduction of around 2,200 by the end of the year.\n\nThe pharma then intends to use its savings to prioritize R&D programs with the greatest return-on-investment potential, as well as those that could set it up for long-term growth. CEO Chris Boerner said at the time that these business adjustments will help BMS become “more agile” and “drive efficiency across the company.”\n\nThe cost cuts appear to be working. In both [Q2](https://www.biospace.com/business/bms-gets-q2-beat-raises-full-year-guidance-as-cost-cutting-initiative-continues) and [Q3](https://www.biospace.com/business/bms-delivers-q3-beat-raises-2024-guidance-amid-strong-demand-for-legacy-and-newer-drugs), the pharma beat analyst expectations, with revenues buoyed by the strong sales of products such as Eliquis and Opdivo. The pharma has also consistently raised its full-year earnings guidance—further evidence of the business’ robust performance.\n\n**November 22**\n\nTo streamline its organization around its most immediate priorities, Sonata Therapeutics is parting with about 20 employees _, Fierce Biotech_ [reported](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/flagship-backed-sonata-says-sayonara-ceo-and-whittles-down-crew-20-employees).

Median duration of response reached 18.3 months in synovial sarcoma patients.\n\nFrom 2025 to 2028, Adaptimmune expects its aggregate savings to reach around $300 million, excluding one-time costs associated with the terminations. This money will allow the biotech to focus on its synovial sarcoma business, including the launch of Tecelra (afamitresgene autoleucel) and the development of lete-cel.

If the Cambridge, Massachusetts, business has the same number of employees now, the cuts could affect about 18 people.\n\nRegarding its antibiotic candidate, Spero shared that an interim analysis of the Phase IIa study of SPR720, a treatment being investigated for nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease, did not meet the primary endpoint.\n\n_For more details, read_ [_the article_](https://www.biospace.com/job-trends/spero-therapeutics-to-lay-off-39-of-employees) _._\n\n**October 28**\n\nAfter announcing a [revenue shortfall](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/icon-reports-third-quarter-2024-results), Dublin-based contract research organization (CRO) ICON signaled during an investor call that layoffs are coming, [_Fierce Biotech_](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/cro/irish-cro-icon-plots-layoffs-after-underwhelming-q3-revenue) reported. In the Oct. 24 call, the company’s CEO, Steve Cutler, shared the business is “looking at where we have an excess of people in certain areas” and “taking fairly decisive actions.” ICON has locations in 45 countries, including the U.S., where it has [offices](https://www.iconplc.com/contact/global-office-locator) in 11 states.\n\nICON’s third-quarter revenue of $2.03 million, a 1.2% year-over-year decrease, failed to meet expectations for three reasons, according to the company’s earnings announcement. The CRO cited material headwinds from two large customers undergoing budget cuts and development model changes; lower than anticipated vaccine-related activity; and “ongoing cautiousness” from biotech customers, resulting in award and study delays.\n\nThe company also noted in its announcement that it expects an “outlook for growth over the medium term” and that its year-to-date revenue is $6.24 million, a year-over-year increase of 3.1%, or 3.2% on a constant currency basis.\n\n**October 25**\n\nFollowing a disappointing Phase III trial of ganaxolone to treat seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), Marinus Pharmaceuticals is laying off employees as part of cost-cutting measures, the company [announced Oct. 24](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/marinus-pharmaceuticals-announces-topline-results-from-phase-3-trusttsc-trial-of-oral-ganaxolone-in-tuberous-sclerosis-complex-and-commences-process-to-explore-strategic-alternatives). The commercial-stage pharma is also discontinuing further clinical development of the drug and exploring strategic alternatives with the goal of “maximizing value for stockholders,” according to the announcement.\n\nRadnor, Pennsylvania–based Marinus did not specify how many people it’s letting go or when the layoffs are effective.

However, that number is likely lower now, as Marinus [announced in May](https://www.biospace.com/marinus-pharmaceuticals-provides-business-update-and-reports-first-quarter-2024-financial-results) that it would reduce its workforce by about 20% as part of cost-cutting measures at that time.\n\nIn its Oct. 24 announcement, Marinus noted that the Phase III TrustTSC trial evaluating oral ganaxolone did not meet the primary endpoint of percent change in 28-day TSC-associated seizure frequency. It added that while reductions in seizure frequency favored the ganaxolone arm, the primary endpoint failed to achieve statistical significance.\n\n**October 23**\n\nAt Pfizer, another group of employees is paying the price for the company’s recent Phase III Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) failure.\n\nThe layoffs, which will affect 75 workers at Pfizer’s Sanford, North Carolina, site, come four months after the company’s investigational DMD therapy, fordadistrogene movaparvovec, [failed to meet](https://www.biospace.com/pfizer-s-gene-therapy-for-duchenne-muscular-dystrophy-fails-phase-iii-trial) the primary efficacy endpoint in a Phase III trial. Pfizer said the cuts are related to that trial failure, according to [_Fierce Pharma_](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/pfizer-lays-75-more-workers-north-carolina-wake-late-stage-dmd-trial-fail).\n\nThis latest wave of layoffs follows the elimination of [150 positions](https://www.commerce.nc.gov/data-tools-reports/labor-market-data-tools/workforce-warn-reports/report-workforce-warn-listings-2024/open) in Sanford immediately after the Phase III DMD readout.

Allen told _KSN_ that more and more manufacturing companies are making such cuts. “This time of year seasonally is obviously a time when employers will do their internal audits and see what their staffing looks like,” Allen said.\n\nThis is Pfizer’s second round of layoffs this month. At the beginning of October, [_The Irish Times_](https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2024/10/01/pfizer-to-cut-another-210-jobs-from-irish-manufacturing-sites/) reported that the company will [eliminate up to 210 manufacturing jobs](https://www.biospace.com/job-trends/bayer-j-j-and-pfizer-to-lay-off-nearly-500-combined-employees) across sites in Grange Castle, Newbridge and Ringaskiddy, Ireland.

In July, the company let go of 220 employees in Massachusetts (189 Cambridge employees and 31 in Lexington). In May, the company separately announced layoffs of 641 in the state (495 in Cambridge and 146 in Lexington) and the shuttering of a San Diego R&D hub that employed 324 people. And in March, Takeda said 190 employees would lose their jobs as a result of shuttering R&D and manufacturing operations at a facility in Orth an der Donau, Austria.\n\nIn total, Takeda has now laid off or announced plans to lay off [more than 1,300 employees](https://www.biospace.com/article/the-6-largest-biopharma-layoffs-of-2024-so-far/) so far in 2024.\n\n**October 17**\n\nAbout a week after [announcing](https://www.biospace.com/drug-development/sage-suffers-third-neuro-stumble-in-six-months-with-disappointing-mid-stage-alzheimers-readout) it’s discontinuing the development of dalzanemdor in Alzheimer’s disease comes news that Sage Therapeutics will [lay off](https://www.biospace.com/job-trends/sage-therapeutics-will-lay-off-33-of-employees-including-over-half-of-r-d) over 165 employees, or about 33% of its workforce.\n\nThe workforce reduction is part of a strategic reorganization of the company’s business operations, according to Sage’s Oct. 17 announcement. The cuts will include roughly 55% of the Cambridge, Massachusetts–based biotech’s R&D workforce and five members of its leadership team. The company expects to mostly complete the layoffs by the end of 2024.\n\nAccording to Sage, the reorganization is meant to support the ongoing launch of Zurzuvae in postpartum depression and focus pipeline development efforts for drug candidate dalzanemdor in Huntington’s disease ahead of a clinical study expected later this year.

The reduction is part of a [major shift](https://www.biospace.com/business/vir-lays-off-25-of-staff-abandons-most-virus-work-and-pivots-to-cancer-in-sanofi-deal) in its research and development priorities in which the biotech will abandon its work on COVID-19 and influenza, as well as its T-cell-based viral vector platform, instead focusing on its hepatitis B and D programs and moving into the cancer space via a [deal with Sanofi](https://investors.vir.bio/news/news-details/2024/Vir-Biotechnology-Acts-on-Expanded-Strategy-of-Powering-the-Immune-System-Through-Exclusive-Worldwide-License-Agreement-with-Sanofi-for-Multiple-Potential-Best-in-Class-Clinical-Stage-T-cell-Engagers/default.aspx).\n\n**August 1**\n\nArbutus Biopharma will lay off 40% of its staff in order to focus resources on its Phase II treatment for chronic hepatitis B infection, the company [announced](https://www.biospace.com/arbutus-reports-second-quarter-2024-financial-results-and-provides-corporate-update) as part of its Q2 financial results on Thursday. “\\[W\\]e have made the difficult decision to discontinue our HBV research efforts and reduce our headcount leading to a projected cash runway into the fourth quarter of 2026,” Arbutus Interim President and CEO Michael J. McElhaugh said in the announcement.\n\nThe British Columbia–based Arbutus had 73 full-time employees as of the end of 2023, according to an [SEC filing](https://investor.arbutusbio.com/static-files/5ee32bf4-e125-4ecc-b481-a6128f2e96ff).\n\n**August 1**\n\nBoston-based HilleVax is laying off 41 employees, about 40% of its workforce, the company [announced](https://www.biospace.com/hillevax-announces-reduction-in-force) Wednesday. In its announcement, the company said the reduction “is intended to preserve cash while maintaining core capabilities as the company explores the potential for continued development” of its vaccine candidates.\n\nHilleVax was [spun out](https://www.biospace.com/takeda-spins-out-hillevax-to-propel-final-development-of-norovirus-vaccine) of Takeda in 2021 in order to continue development of its norovirus vaccine.\n\n**August 1**\n\n[Bayer](https://www.biospace.com/employer/247809/bayer) will lay off a further 70 people at its Whippany, NJ headquarters, the company revealed in a July [WARN notice](https://www.nj.gov/labor/assets/PDFs/WARN/2024_WARN_Notice_Archive.pdf). The reductions will be effective at the end of October. “We are adopting a new operating model and with it, a new organizational structure,” a company spokesperson stated in an email to [_Fierce Pharma_](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/bayer-lops-70-more-employees-new-jersey-headquarters).\n\nIn May, Bayer announced that it had already re[duced its headcount](https://www.biospace.com/bayer-cuts-1-500-jobs-lowers-2024-earnings-guidance-as-q1-sales-dip) by about 1,500 in 2024, mainly by eliminating management positions. The company was surpassed only by Bristol Myers Squibb for the [most layoffs in biopharma](https://www.biospace.com/the-6-largest-biopharma-layoffs-of-2024-so-far) in the first five months of this year.\n\n## July\n\n**July 31**\n\n[FibroGen](https://www.biospace.com/search?q=fibrogen+inc+) will eliminate 75% of its U.S.-based workforce after two late-stage trials failed to meet the primary endpoint of overall survival, the company [announced](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/07/30/2921378/33525/en/FibroGen-Announces-Topline-Results-from-Two-Late-Stage-Pamrevlumab-Pancreatic-Cancer-Studies-and-Provides-Corporate-Update.html) Wednesday. FibroGen has 475 employees globally, according to its website.\n\nA Phase II/III trial investigated FibroGen’s experimental drug pamrevlumab in combination with gemcitabine in the first and second line in metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (mPDAC) patients, while a separate Phase III trial assessed pamrevlumab combined with gemcitabine or Folfirinox to treat pancreatic cancer.\n\nThe company is implementing an “immediate and significant” cost reduction plan to terminate the pamrevlumab program, halt any obligations to the drug, and reduce its headcount, according to the press release. FibroGen previously cut 104 employees last year after another phase III failure, [according to _Fierce Biotech_](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/fibrogens-cost-cutting-search-spurs-layoffs-104-employees).\n\n**July 30**\n\n[Pfizer](https://www.biospace.com/employer/394762/pfizer) will lay off 150 employees from its facility in Sanford, NC, and 60 from its site in Rocky Mount, NC, the pharma giant disclosed in a [WARN notice](https://www.commerce.nc.gov/data-tools-reports/labor-market-data-tools/workforce-warn-reports/report-workforce-warn-listings-2024/open) last week. While the WARN notice lists the layoffs as closures, the two sites will in fact remain open, a company spokesperson told [_Fierce Pharma_](https://www.fiercepharma.com/manufacturing/pfizer-lays-210-north-carolina-after-duchenne-gene-therapy-flop). The Sanford site is involved in gene therapy programs, while the Rocky Mount facility makes sterile injectables, _Fierce_ reports.\n\nAfter a downturn in sales of its COVID products, Pfizer announced a [$3.5 billion cost-cutting initiative](https://www.biospace.com/pfizer-kicks-off-3-5b-cost-cutting-program-as-covid-revenues-decline) last October, and has since implemented several rounds of layoffs. In May of this year, the company [disclosed plans](https://www.biospace.com/pfizer-targets-another-1-5b-in-cost-cuts-by-end-of-2027) to cut a further $1.5 billion in costs over the next several years.\n\n**July 29**\n\nBoston-based [Cue Biopharma](https://www.biospace.com/search?q=cue+biopharma)[announced](https://www.biospace.com/cue-biopharma-announces-strategic-prioritization-of-autoimmune-programs-enabling-optimization-of-workforce-and-reduction-of-capital-requirements) on Thursday a shift in priorities that will entail laying off a quarter of its staff. The company will focus resources on its autoimmune program while seeking partners to continue development of its oncology candidates, Cue CEO Daniel Passeri said in the announcement. The realignment will extend Cue’s cash runway into mid-2025, the company said.\n\nAs of the day before the announcement, Cue had about 50 employees, Passeri told [_Endpoints News_](https://endpts.com/cue-biopharma-prioritizes-autoimmune-pipeline-axes-a-quarter-of-staff-to-save-cash/).\n\n**July 26**\n\nAnokion, a Switzerland- and Massachusetts-based company focused on autoimmune disease, will lay off an undisclosed number of staff, a spokesperson told [_Fierce Biotech_](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/fierce-biotech-layoff-tracker-2024). The company plans to focus resources on its lead candidate, a drug for celiac disease that is currently in Phase II.\n\n**July 26**\n\nFollowing a meeting with the FDA and the determination that its candidate for relapsed and refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) will require an additional clinical trial, [GlycoMimetics](https://www.biospace.com/search?q=glycomimetics+inc+) will lay off approximately 80% of its staff. The company will also undergo a strategic review on how best to move forward, it said in a Thursday [announcement](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240725473857/en/GlycoMimetics-Announces-Strategic-Review-and-Corporate-Restructuring-Plan). The Rockville, MD–based company was notified by the Nasdaq in June that its stock price has dropped below the $1/share needed to qualify for listing on the stock market, it revealed in an [SEC filing](https://ir.glycomimetics.com/node/12281/html) on Friday. As of the end of 2023, GlycoMimetics had [35 full-time employees](https://ir.glycomimetics.com/static-files/55bf74d7-f0af-40d2-9a90-2ad1d3e72279).\n\n**July 26**\n\nCambridge, Mass.–based [Relay Therapeutics](https://www.biospace.com/employer/551742/relay-therapeutics) has laid off less than 5% of its 300-person workforce, a spokesperson told [_Fierce Biotech_](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/fierce-biotech-layoff-tracker-2024). The company, which focuses on precision oncology and genetic disease, saw the [termination](https://ir.relaytx.com/static-files/3b806ebc-9294-4b9f-b67e-7403ae298bb3) earlier this month of an [agreement with Genentech](https://www.biospace.com/relay-therapeutics-to-pass-baton-to-genentech-for-development-of-tumor-treatment) around development and commercialization of a small molecule cancer drug. But the spokesperson told _Fierce_ the layoff was unrelated to the dissolution of that deal.\n\n**July 24**\n\nMerck let go some 75 to 80 people this week, [_STAT_ reported](https://www.statnews.com/2024/07/24/biotech-news-merck-sage-geron-pfizer-fda-jeff-shuren-pharmacy-benefit-managers/) Wednesday. The layoffs, which came across multiple groups, affected the company’s early research division, according to the publication.\n\n**July 22**\n\n[Rapt Therapeutics](https://www.biospace.com/search?q=rapt+therapeutics+inc+) will “reduce its workforce by 47 people, or approximately 40% of the Company’s existing headcount” in order to conserve cash resources, the company revealed in an [SEC filing](https://investors.rapt.com/static-files/84249289-2223-441f-bb6f-0fbe5e744ca4) dated July 19. The South San Francisco–based biotech suffered a setback in February when the FDA [placed a hold](https://www.biospace.com/fda-puts-clinical-hold-on-rapt-therapeutics-lead-candidate-in-two-trials) on two Phase II trials of its candidate zelnecirnon after a case of liver failure. In addition to zelnecirnon, which is being developed for asthma and atopic dermatitis, Rapt has a second clinical-stage candidate, tivumecirnon, in trials for cancer.\n\n**July 18**\n\nAslan Pharmaceuticals is liquidating its assets and has terminated all of its employees, the Singapore-based biopharma [announced](https://www.biospace.com/aslan-pharmaceuticals-announces-it-has-filed-for-voluntary-liquidation-of-its-sole-operating-subsidiary-and-is-commencing-steps-to-place-itself-into-voluntary-liquidation) Wednesday. Its directors had determined “that ASLAN SG cannot by reason of its liabilities continue its business,” according to the announcement. The company also said it had received a delisting determination from the Nasdaq on July 15 “due to its failure to meet continued listing requirements,” and that it elected not to request a hearing about the determination.\n\nAccording to an SEC filing, as of the end of 2023 Aslan had 20 employees in Singapore, 14 in the U.S. and one in the U.K.\n\n**July 16**\n\n[Caribou Biosciences](https://www.biospace.com/search?q=caribou+biosciences+inc) has parted with 21 people—12% of its workforce—as it discontinues preclinical development of allogeneic [CAR-NK therapies](https://www.biospace.com/can-nk-cell-therapy-avoid-car-t-s-shortcomings), the company [reported to the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1619856/000161985624000054/crbu-20240716.htm) on Tuesday. The filing added that the layoffs will be completed by the end of the third quarter and that its cash runway will be extended into the second half of 2026 as it focuses resources on its allogeneic (or off-the-shelf) CAR T cell therapy platform.\n\n**July 12**\n\nRoche’s [Spark Therapeutics](https://www.biospace.com/employer/398039/spark-therapeutics/) is laying off staffers and halting some of its early-stage programs, [_Endpoints News_](https://endpts.com/roches-gene-therapy-biotech-spark-is-laying-off-employees-ending-some-early-stage-programs/)reported Thursday. A spokesperson for the Philadelphia-based gene therapy biotech told the publication that the company is pivoting its strategy to “accelerate its pipeline and help bring more therapies to patients sooner, but this move will include ‘organizational changes.’” Notifications about employment were sent out this week, although no indication was given of how many people would be let go.\n\nSpark has two late-stage [trials](https://sparktx.com/scientific-platform-programs/) in hemophilia A and hemophilia B in its pipeline and an early-stage asset for treating Pompe disease. The biotech has around [800 employees](https://www.roche.com/innovation/structure/spark) and was purchased by the Swiss pharma in 2019 for approximately [$4.8 billion](https://sparktx.com/press_releases/spark-therapeutics-enters-into-definitive-merger-agreement-with-roche/).\n\n**July 11**\n\nSwiss pharma [Novartis](https://www.biospace.com/employer/551985/novartis/) has let go of 29 employees in San Diego and will eliminate approximately 100 more jobs as it winds down its development site there, the [_San Diego Union-Tribune_](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2024/07/10/pharmaceutical-giant-novartis-shutting-down-its-san-diego-research-site/) reported Wednesday. A company spokesperson told the outlet in an email that “a set of changes to build future capabilities and access global talent pools will be implemented over the next 2 to 3 years, with parallel build-up and reduction of roles in certain locations.”\n\nIn April, [_Reuters_](https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/novartis-cut-680-jobs-product-development-2024-04-09/) reported that Novartis was planning to cut hundreds of development jobs worldwide, including 240 in the U.S.\n\n_Correction (July his entry has been updated to state that the site affected is a development site, not a research site._ BioSpace _regrets the error._\n\n**July 11**\n\nVirginia-based [Indivior](https://www.biospace.com/employer/544083/indivior/) will cease sales and marketing of its schizophrenia drug Perseris and lay off approximately 130 sales staff, the company [announced](https://otp.tools.investis.com/clients/uk/indivior2/rns/regulatory-story.aspx?newsid=1840448&cid=971) Tuesday. The company, which focuses on treatments for mental illness and substance use disorder, ascribed its decision to “the highly competitive market and impending changes that are expected to intensify payor management in the treatment category in which PERSERIS participates.”\n\n**July 3**\n\nOncology biopharma [Apollomics](https://www.biospace.com/employer/401183/apollomics-inc-/) is letting go of two members of its leadership team as well as an unspecified number of staff, the company [announced](https://ir.apollomicsinc.com/news-releases/news-release-details/apollomics-announces-updated-strategic-focus-and-leadership-team) Tuesday. “As a result of the updated strategic focus, and aligned with the Company’s resource needs going forward, Sanjeev Redkar, Ph.D., Company co-founder and President, and Peony Yu, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, are expected to transition to consulting roles in August,” the announcement stated, also noting the departure of “other employees.” The reductions are linked to the company’s narrowing of the target patient population for its candidate vebreltinib, currently in a Phase II clinical trial for certain tumors.\n\n**July 3**\n\n[CureVac](https://www.biospace.com/employer/540844/curevac/) will reduce its workforce by 30% as it [restructures its mRNA collaboration](https://www.biospace.com/article/gsk-pays-430m-upfront-for-curevac-s-covid-19-flu-mrna-vaccines/) with GSK, the German company [announced](https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/curevac-initiates-strategic-restructuring-to-align-resources-with-focus-on-high-value-mrna-pipeline-opportunities/) Tuesday. The two companies began collaborating on mRNA vaccines in 2020 and have candidates for seasonal influenza, COVID-19 and avian influenza in the pipeline. Under the new agreement, GSK “will assume full control of developing and manufacturing these candidate vaccines,” according to the [announcement](https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/gsk-and-curevac-to-restructure-collaboration-into-new-licensing-agreement/).\n\nMeanwhile, CureVac said its reduction in force will “create a leaner, more agile organization re-focused on technology innovation, research and development” and extend its cash runway into 2028. The company employed 1,172 worldwide as of the end of 2023, according to an [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1809122/000141057824000531/cvac-20231231x20f.htm), and had already shed about 150 employees through a “[voluntary leaver](https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/curevac-announces-financial-results-for-the-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2023-and-provides-business-update-/)” program in April.\n\n**July 2**\n\n[Takeda](https://www.biospace.com/employer/401082/takeda/) will lay off a further 220 employees in Massachusetts, the company disclosed in a June 27 [WARN notice](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/worker-adjustment-and-retraining-act-warn).

In total, Takeda has now laid off or announced plans to lay off [more than 1,300 employees](https://www.biospace.com/article/the-6-largest-biopharma-layoffs-of-2024-so-far/) so far in 2024, on top of staffing cuts it made in [2023](https://www.biospace.com/article/takeda-cuts-180-jobs-amid-pipeline-shake-up/).\n\nA Takeda spokesperson told [_Endpoints_](https://endpts.com/takeda-to-lay-off-more-employees-in-massachusetts/) in an emailed statement the company is prioritizing “increasing organizational agility, improving procurement savings, and strengthening how we leverage data, digital and technology across Takeda. . . . As we continue to work to bring these initiatives to fruition, difficult choices will also be required, and some employees will be impacted as a result.”\n\n**July 1**\n\nWaltham, Massachusetts–based Aerovate Therapeutics will lay off “nearly all of its workforce” in the coming months following the [Phase IIb failure](https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/aerovate-therapeutics-announces-24-week-topline-results-from-the-phase-2b-portion-of-impahct-evaluating-/) of its candidate for pulmonary arterial hypertension, the company [disclosed to the SEC](https://ir.aerovatetx.com/static-files/3b806cf8-c984-4ffd-af26-2007fb8745f3) on June 25. Aerovate added that it has already notified 39 people—78% of its workforce—of their terminations.\n\n**July 1**\n\nSwiss biotech [GeNeuro](https://www.biospace.com/employer/537753/geneuro/) is laying off all but two of its staff members in the wake of the Phase II failure of its candidate for long COVID, the company [announced](https://geneuro.ch/wp-content/uploads/GeNeuro_GNC501-Results_28062024_EN-3.pdf) Friday. GeNeuro “has made redundant 7 of its 9 employment agreements, including all of the Executive Management,” the announcement said. “All employees and managers will work through their notice periods, of up to 6 months, to execute the strategy that will be defined by the Board over the coming days.”\n\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.biospace.com%2Fbiospace-layoff-tracker&text=Layoff%20Tracker%3A%20Shape%2C%20Vor%20Cut%20Workforces)\n- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.biospace.com%2Fbiospace-layoff-tracker&mini=true&title=Layoff%20Tracker%3A%20Shape%2C%20Vor%20Cut%20Workforces&summary=Follow%20along%20as%20BioSpace%20tracks%20job%20cuts%20and%20restructuring%20initiatives%20throughout%202025.&source=BioSpace)\n- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=2120989681618413&display=popup&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.biospace.com%2Fbiospace-layoff-tracker)\n- [Email](mailto:?subject=Check%20out%20this%20article%20on%20BioSpace&body=Layoff%20Tracker%3A%20Shape%2C%20Vor%20Cut%20Workforces%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.biospace.com%2Fbiospace-layoff-tracker%0A%0AFollow%20along%20as%20BioSpace%20tracks%20job%20cuts%20and%20restructuring%20initiatives%20throughout%202025.)\n- [Print](javascript:window.print())\n\n[Bankruptcy](https://www.biospace.com/bankruptcy) [Layoffs](https://www.biospace.com/layoffs)\n\n[BioSpace Editorial Staff](https://www.biospace.com/biospace-editorial-staff)\n\nMORE ON THIS TOPIC\n\n[![Trendy halftone collage.

Last month, for instance, the FDA missed its target decision dates for [Novavax’s COVID-19 vaccine](https://www.biospace.com/fda/after-missed-decision-deadline-novavax-says-covid-19-shot-approvable) and [Stealth BioTherapeutics’ Barth Syndrome drug](https://www.biospace.com/fda/fda-misses-another-deadline-amid-staff-exodus-structural-disruptions). The regulator has also yet to [release](https://www.biospace.com/fda/fda-delays-continue-as-regulator-misses-review-date-for-gsks-nucala) its verdict on GSK’s chronic obstructive pulmonary disease bid for Nucala. Its target action date for that was May 7.\n\nLayoffs at the agency could be to blame. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has enacted a [sweeping reorganization](https://www.biospace.com/policy/rfk-jr-to-cut-10-000-jobs-across-hhs) of the department, a drastic move that put 3,500 jobs at the FDA on the chopping block. While it is yet unclear how extensively the FDA’s review staff were affected by these layoffs, several former officials and analysts have [flagged the possibility](https://www.biospace.com/fda/fda-layoffs-continue-as-former-commissioner-robert-califf-speaks-out) that the cuts could lead to regulatory roadblocks and delays.\n\nThe move to incorporate generative AI into its review process is a “historic first” for the FDA, the agency claimed on Thursday, one that Makary says will “reduce the amount of non-productive busywork that has historically consumed much of the review process.”\n\nThe FDA is moving quickly with its AI rollout “to reflect the urgency of this effort,” as per its Thursday release. All FDA centers have been instructed to start implementing the AI approach immediately, building toward full integration by June 30.\n\nAnd the FDA isn’t stopping at just integrating AI into decision making. The agency on Thursday also laid out plans to deepen its generative AI capabilities across all centers, with the idea of tailoring AI models to the needs of the relevant center.\n\nIn line with its AI push, the FDA recently named Jeremy Walsh as its first-ever head of AI and IT at the agency. Walsh, who made the announcement last week in a [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jeremy-walsh-1a2a8a150_im-happy-to-share-that-im-starting-a-new-activity-7323998342319923201-Z5CR/), was previously chief technologist at the tech services and consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton.\n\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.biospace.com%2Ffda%2Famid-layoffs-delays-fda-turns-to-ai-for-speedy-reviews&text=Amid%20Layoffs%2C%20Delays%2C%20FDA%20Turns%20to%20AI%20for%20Speedy%20Reviews)\n- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.biospace.com%2Ffda%2Famid-layoffs-delays-fda-turns-to-ai-for-speedy-reviews&mini=true&title=Amid%20Layoffs%2C%20Delays%2C%20FDA%20Turns%20to%20AI%20for%20Speedy%20Reviews&summary=The%20FDA%20expects%20to%20fully%20integrate%20its%20AI%20approach%20by%20June%2030%2C%20though%20its%20different%20centers%20have%20been%20instructed%20to%20start%20the%20rollout%20immediately.&source=BioSpace)\n- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=2120989681618413&display=popup&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.biospace.com%2Ffda%2Famid-layoffs-delays-fda-turns-to-ai-for-speedy-reviews)\n- [Email](mailto:?subject=Check%20out%20this%20article%20on%20BioSpace&body=Amid%20Layoffs%2C%20Delays%2C%20FDA%20Turns%20to%20AI%20for%20Speedy%20Reviews%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.biospace.com%2Ffda%2Famid-layoffs-delays-fda-turns-to-ai-for-speedy-reviews%0A%0AThe%20FDA%20expects%20to%20fully%20integrate%20its%20AI%20approach%20by%20June%2030%2C%20though%20its%20different%20centers%20have%20been%20instructed%20to%20start%20the%20rollout%20immediately.)\n- [Print](javascript:window.print())\n\n[Artificial intelligence](https://www.biospace.com/artificial-intelligence) [Regulatory](https://www.biospace.com/regulatory) [Policy](https://www.biospace.com/tag/policy) [Government](https://www.biospace.com/government)\n\n[![Tristan Manalac](https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/0e8ed9c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/676x676+12+0/resize/200x200!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F3d%2F8e%2Fbfb5a7f141d1ada6382cc25f8825%2Ftristan-cropped.jpg)](https://www.biospace.com/tristan-manalac)\n\n[![Tristan Manalac](https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/0e8ed9c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/676x676+12+0/resize/200x200!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F3d%2F8e%2Fbfb5a7f141d1ada6382cc25f8825%2Ftristan-cropped.jpg)Tristan Manalac](https://www.biospace.com/tristan-manalac)\n\nTristan is an independent science writer based in Metro Manila, with more than eight years of experience writing about medicine, biotech and science.

But several [media outlets](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/fda-misses-another-approval-decision-deadline-time-gsks-nucala-copd) on Thursday reported that an announcement has yet to be made.\n\nIn a statement to _Fierce Pharma_, a GSK spokesperson confirmed that the company has not received a decision from the FDA, but noted that it does “not comment on ongoing discussions with regulatory authorities.”\n\n“The FDA is actively reviewing our submission for Nucala in COPD \\[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\\] and we are working closely with them to help bring this important treatment option to patients as quickly as possible,” the spokesperson told _Fierce._“Based on our latest discussions with the FDA, we continue to expect approval.”\n\n_BioSpace_ has reached out to GSK for independent confirmation of the delay and will update this article accordingly.\n\nThe FDA in recent weeks has started to show lapses in its regulatory function and delays with its review process. Last month, for instance, the agency [failed](https://www.biospace.com/fda/fda-misses-review-deadline-for-novavaxs-covid-19-shot-days-after-marks-resignation) to provide Novavax with a verdict for its updated COVID-19 shot by the target date of April 1. The vaccine [remains in limbo](https://www.biospace.com/business/novavax-sales-jump-600-yoy-as-covid-19-vaccine-still-in-limbo-at-fda), though the company stands by its application—in late April, Novavax [insisted](https://www.biospace.com/fda/after-missed-decision-deadline-novavax-says-covid-19-shot-approvable) that the shot was “approvable” and revealed that the FDA has asked for a post-marketing commitment to collect additional data.\n\nThe agency similarly [failed to meet](https://stealthbt.com/stealth-biotherapeutics-announces-delay-in-fda-action-date-for-barth-syndrome-application/) its target decision date for Stealth BioTherapeutics’ elamipretide, an investigational drug for the ultra-rare disease Barth Syndrome. According to the biotech’s news release, the FDA should have released a verdict on April 29—but the regulator informed the company on the day itself that it would not meet that target action date.\n\nEarlier this week, the FDA [put out a Federal Register notice](https://www.biospace.com/fda/fda-vaccine-advisors-to-meet-for-covid-19-vaccine-updates) announcing an upcoming meeting for its vaccine advisers. The posting, however, fell short of the customary 15-day advance notice for such meetings. The panel discussion is scheduled for May 22, while the Register notice was posted on May 8.\n\nThe FDA itself conceded that it came up short: “FDA regrets that it was unable to publish this notice 15 days prior to the \\[meeting\\] due to technical issues.” Still, the agency is pushing through with the meeting, citing the “exceptional circumstances” that warrant the expert discussion.\n\nSince Robert F. Kennedy Jr. assumed the role of Secretary of Health and Human Services in February, the FDA has lost some 3,500 employees to layoffs, though the number is likely higher owing to voluntary exits.\n\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.biospace.com%2Ffda%2Ffda-delays-continue-as-regulator-misses-review-date-for-gsks-nucala&text=FDA%20Delays%20Continue%20as%20Regulator%20Misses%20Review%20Date%20for%20GSK%27s%20Nucala)\n- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.biospace.com%2Ffda%2Ffda-delays-continue-as-regulator-misses-review-date-for-gsks-nucala&mini=true&title=FDA%20Delays%20Continue%20as%20Regulator%20Misses%20Review%20Date%20for%20GSK%27s%20Nucala&summary=The%20missed%20PDUFA%20adds%20to%20a%20string%20of%20delays%20at%20the%20FDA%20in%20recent%20weeks%2C%20including%20at%20least%20two%20other%20missed%20target%20action%20dates.&source=BioSpace)\n- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=2120989681618413&display=popup&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.biospace.com%2Ffda%2Ffda-delays-continue-as-regulator-misses-review-date-for-gsks-nucala)\n- [Email](mailto:?subject=Check%20out%20this%20article%20on%20BioSpace&body=FDA%20Delays%20Continue%20as%20Regulator%20Misses%20Review%20Date%20for%20GSK%27s%20Nucala%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.biospace.com%2Ffda%2Ffda-delays-continue-as-regulator-misses-review-date-for-gsks-nucala%0A%0AThe%20missed%20PDUFA%20adds%20to%20a%20string%20of%20delays%20at%20the%20FDA%20in%20recent%20weeks%2C%20including%20at%20least%20two%20other%20missed%20target%20action%20dates.)\n- [Print](javascript:window.print())\n\n[Regulatory](https://www.biospace.com/regulatory) [FDA](https://www.biospace.com/tag/fda)\n\n[![Tristan Manalac](https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/0e8ed9c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/676x676+12+0/resize/200x200!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F3d%2F8e%2Fbfb5a7f141d1ada6382cc25f8825%2Ftristan-cropped.jpg)](https://www.biospace.com/tristan-manalac)\n\n[![Tristan Manalac](https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/0e8ed9c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/676x676+12+0/resize/200x200!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F3d%2F8e%2Fbfb5a7f141d1ada6382cc25f8825%2Ftristan-cropped.jpg)Tristan Manalac](https://www.biospace.com/tristan-manalac)\n\nTristan is an independent science writer based in Metro Manila, with more than eight years of experience writing about medicine, biotech and science.
